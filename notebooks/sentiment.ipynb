A class action lawsuit has already been filed.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 1, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.', \"WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\", \"DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Boeing had been prioritizing its profits over safety, which led to poor quality control standards in the production of its commercial aircrafts such as the 737 MAX and (2) as a result, there was a heightened risk of manufacturing flaws that could render Boeing's new airplanes unsafe, which materialized during the Class Period. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\", 'To join the Boeing class action, go to  mailto:or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [email\\xa0protected] or [email\\xa0protected] for information on the class action.', \"No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point.

I have an amazing amount of confidence in the work that they do.\", \"They bring experts to the investigation, and they take all the time that's necessary to draw accurate conclusions, and we intend to be there with them. As part of that NTSB process, I cannot comment on any specific root cause or speculate a root cause. As a participant in the process, I do believe the investigation will narrow quickly. Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened.\", 'Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories. We simply must be better. Our customers deserve better. I want to remind everybody what a great job the pilots and the crew at Alaska Airlines did in responding to a desperate moment.', \"I also want to remind everybody what a terrific job the leadership at Alaska Airlines did, grounding the airplane and ensuring safety. Alaska Airlines did exactly what companies like Boeing would hope that they do at a moment like that, and that is why the airline industry is as safe as it is. We caused the problem, and we understand that. Over these last few weeks, I've had tough conversations with our customers, with our regulators, congressional leaders, and more.\", \"We understand why they are angry, and we will work to earn their confidence. There is no message, no slogan that will accomplish that. It's all about real demonstrated action and absolute transparency every step of the way. So, let's talk about those steps.\", 'Our team has worked diligently to help our customers restore their 737-9 airplanes to service. The FAA approved the detailed inspection protocol last Wednesday. And today, all 737-9 operators are safely returning their airplanes in service. More broadly, we are taking immediate and comprehensive action to strengthen quality at Boeing and within our supply chain.', 'We instituted additional quality controls and inspections at Boeing and at our supplier. We issued bulletins to suppliers to strengthen the focus on conformance and reducing the risks of quality escapes. We opened our factories to 737 operators for additional direct oversight. And we appointed an expert quality advisor to conduct a comprehensive and independent review of our commercial airplane quality management system, and they will remain with us for many years.', \"Most importantly, last week, we paused 737 production for the day as more than 10,000 teammates across Renton, Seattle, and Moses Lake stopped to focus on safety and quality and only safety and quality. This was a quality stand down at a scale we have never done before, and we're going to keep doing them across our commercial factories. In addition to our internal actions, the FAA has announced new oversight of our 737 manufacturing. We will cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA at every turn.\", \"We respect their role as our regulator, and we will follow their direction in every step on production. Today, we're producing 737s at a rate of 38 per month, and we will remain at that rate until the FAA and Boeing is satisfied with our quality and manufacturing process. This increased scrutiny, whether it comes from us, from our regulator, or from third parties, will make us better. It's that simple.\", \"Over the last several years, we've taken close care not to push the system too fast, and we have never hesitated to slow down, to halt production, or to stop deliveries to take the time we need to get things right. Nobody knows that better than our investors. As you know, we stopped delivering 787s for over a year to ensure that each conform to our exacting specifications prior to delivery. And on the 737 line, we have regularly slowed rate breaks to support the stability of the overall production system and to correct nonconformances when identified.\", 'But this accident makes it absolutely clear we have more work to do. I know that these moments that impact delivery schedules can frustrate our customers and our investors, but quality and safety must come above all else. And our customers and our investors know that and are in there with us. On that note, as you will see, we are not issuing financial outlook for 2024 today.', \"Now is not the time for that. We won't predict timing. We won't get ahead of our regulator. We will go slow to go fast.\", \"And we will encourage and reward employees for speaking up to slow things down if that's what's needed. We will simply focus on every next airplane and ensuring we meet all the standards that we have, all the standards that our regulator has and that our customers demand. As we go about that work, we remain confident in our recovery. Since day one, we've been focused squarely on inculcating safety and quality into everything that we do and getting back to our legacy of having engineering excellence at the center of our business.\", \"That focus and commitment is unwavering, and we will continue to strengthen our processes and our execution every step of the way. Most importantly, we will be transparent every step of the way. And with our 170,000 employees in mind, I'd like to close with a message directly to our team. We have confidence in you and we have confidence in Boeing.\", 'We have confidence in our airplanes. I know how seriously you take your work. Our men and women on the manufacturing floor and in our engineering offices know exactly what we must do. You know your work better than anyone else on the planet.', 'Use your voice. Speak up. Focus on every next detail. We will seek out and act on your feedback.', \"We're in a challenging moment. We will earn trust back through demonstrated action and a commitment to total transparency. I'm confident in you. I'm confident in our company.\", 'And that together, we will do just that. Brian, over to you.', 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', \"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's start off with the total company financial performance for the quarter. Revenue was $22 billion. That's up 10% year over year.\", 'Growth was driven by higher commercial volume and favorable mix. The core loss per share was $0.47, better than last year, primarily on improved commercial volume, better mix, and lower abnormal costs. They were offset by lower defense margins and higher period expenses, including RD, which we expected. Free cash flow was $3 billion in the quarter, in line with the prior year and up sequentially from the third quarter, primarily due to improved commercial deliveries and strong order activity, which drove favorable advanced payment timing, some of which was anticipated in the first quarter of 2024.', \"Turning to the next page, I'll cover Boeing commercial airplanes. BCA booked 611 net orders in the quarter, with 411 737s, including an order with Akasa 98 777Xs, largely an Emirates order and 83 787s. We have over 5,600 airplanes in backlog, valued at $441 billion. BCA delivered 157 airplanes in the quarter, and revenue was $10.5 billion.\", \"That's up 13%, driven by higher wide-body deliveries and favorable mix. Operating margin was just positive at 0.4%, driven by returning to normal 737 delivery levels in the quarter, improved mix, as well as lower abnormal costs associated with getting to five per month on the 87 and resuming production on the 777X. Now, I'll give more color on the key programs. On the 737, we delivered 110 airplanes in the quarter and 45 in December.\", \"The program also began FAA certification flight testing on the 737-10 in December. For the year, we delivered 396 airplanes, on the upper end of the revised guidance range we provided in October. For the FAA announcement, we'll maintain production at 38 per month and work transparently with the FAA to complete all requirements for future increases. At the same time, we'll continue to prioritize the master schedule to avoid disruption in our supply chain.\", \"On the 737-9, we're actively supporting our customers' return to service activities. And as of today, the majority are back flying. In our factory, we have 10 -9s in production, all of which will undergo the FAA-approved inspection process prior to delivery. Spirit has also adopted this inspection routine in its factory.\", \"The quarter ended with about 200 MAX airplanes in inventory. It's important to think about this inventory in three buckets. First, there are 140 737-8s built prior to 2023. The vast majority are for customers in China and India.\", 'We still expect to deliver most of these airplanes by year-end as we work toward shutting down the shadow factory. In the second bucket, there were around 25 airplanes produced in 2023 that are still in WIP given the disruptions in the second half of last year, and we expect these to deliver in 2024. And lastly, there are approximately 35 -7s and -10s that we will deliver once those airplanes are certified. The timing of which will be determined by the FAA.', \"Moving on to the 787. We delivered 23 airplanes in the quarter, including 11 in December. For the year, we delivered 73 airplanes, within the guidance range we originally outlined for 2023. The program successfully transitioned production to five per month in the quarter, and still plan to steadily work our way to 10 per month in the '25, '26 time frame.\", 'We ended the quarter with approximately 60 airplanes in inventory, about 50 of which require rework, which continues to progress steadily. We still expect to deliver most of these airplanes by year-end as we finish the rework and shut down the shadow factory. We booked $77 million of abnormal cost in the quarter and have approximately 300 million left to go that will wind down by year-end, in line with our expectations. On the 777X, we resumed production in the quarter and continue to progress along the program timeline, which remains unchanged.', 'During the quarter, the Emirates order for 90 777Xs brought the program backlog to more than 400 airplanes and also extended the accounting quantity. We continue to follow the lead of the FAA as we progress through the certification process, including working to obtain approval from the FAA to begin certification flight testing. We booked $71 million of abnormal cost in the quarter, which is now fully behind us after resuming production, in line with our expectations. Moving to the next page, Boeing defense and space.', 'BDS booked $8 billion in orders during the quarter, including the Lot 10 award from the U.S. Air Force for 15 KC-46A tankers. The backlog is now at $59 billion. Revenue was $6.7 billion, up 9% on the tanker award and improved volume, and BDS delivered 52 aircraft and two satellites in the quarter.', \"Operating margin was minus 1.5% in the quarter, a sequential improvement from 3Q, but still, we have more work to do. 4Q results were impacted by cost true-ups on three fixed-price development programs totaling $139 million, as well as unfavorable performance and mix on other programs. Our game plan to get BDS back to high single-digit margins by the '25, '26 time frame remains unchanged. Our core business remains solid, representing 60% of our revenue and performing in the mid- to high-single-digit margin range.\", \"The demand for these products is very strong, and we need to execute, compete, and grow these offerings. On the 25% of the portfolio, primarily comprised of fighter satellite programs, operational performance stabilized as we exited the year. And as a result, the fourth quarter saw improved margin trends, although still negative. We still expect to return to the strong historical performance levels as we roll in new contracts with tighter underwriting disciplines as we move into the '25, '26 time frame.\", 'Lastly, we have our fixed-price development programs that represent the remaining 15% of revenue. Despite the relatively modest cost true-ups in the quarter, we continue to focus on maturing these programs and retiring risks quarter in and quarter out, and we made some good progress in the fourth quarter. In addition to capturing the tanker award from the U.S. Air Force, the program delivered nine aircraft in the fourth quarter, continuing to build positive momentum in spite of the supply related disruptions to the factory that we faced earlier last year.', \"And on the T-7A, the first Red Hawk arrived at Edwards Air Force Base in November, formally starting the Air Force development flight test campaign for the aircraft. Overall, the defense portfolio is poised to improve. The strong demand across the customer base, the products are performing the field, and we're confident that our efforts to drive execution and stability will return this business to performance levels that our investors recognize. Moving on to the next page, Boeing global services.\", 'BGS had another strong quarter. They received $6 billion in orders, and the backlog is now at $20 billion. Revenue was $4.8 billion, up 6%, primarily on favorable commercial volume and mix. Operating margins were a very strong 17.4%, an expansion of 350 basis points versus last year as both our commercial and government businesses were delivering double-digit margins.', \"In the quarter, BGS opened a parts distribution center in India and received a follow-on contract to provide sustainment for the C-17. Turning to the next page, I'll cover cash and debt. On cash and marketable securities, we ended the quarter at $16 billion. On debt, the balance remained flat at $52.3 billion.\", \"And over the next few days, we'll pay down $4 billion of the $5 billion of maturities coming due this year from our available cash on hand. We continue to maintain access to $10 billion of revolving credit facilities, all of which remain undrawn. Our liquidity position remains strong. Our investment-grade credit rating continues to be a priority.\", \"And we're developing -- deploying capital in line with the priorities we've shared previously: invest in the business and pay down debt. Turning to the next page, I'll cover our full year financials. Full year revenue was $77.8 billion, up 17% year over year. Growth was driven by improved commercial volume, primarily on higher 787 deliveries.\", \"The core loss per share was $5.81, better than prior year, primarily on improved commercial volume and mix, as well as lower fixed-price development charges in defense. Free cash flow was $4.4 billion for the year, up versus prior year, primarily on higher 787 deliveries and favorable receipt timing that was partially offset by higher expenditures as we increase production rates and invest in the business. While we're postponing issuing 2024 guidance today given our current focus, we're committed to sharing timely and transparent updates moving forward. I would like to provide some additional context on our path forward.\", \"We always knew 2024 was going to be an important year in our recovery. Based on what we know today, we expect another steady year of free cash flow, driven by the 737 production at 38 per month, ongoing execution of the 787 toward our long-term objectives, continued liquidation of our 737 and 787 inventory, and continued focus to wind down both shadow factories. Our defense business will continue to improve as we mature fixed-price programs and transition recently challenged programs with better underwriting disciplines that we've already started to see. And BGS will continue to generate strong free cash flow.\", \"Longer term, we're focused on quality and stability, which will ultimately drive free cash flow. Nothing has changed on the demand front, and the backlog is strong and growing. Remember, our '25, '26 guidance was based on achieving stability, and we have to earn that by applying resources to fix our issues and demonstrate predictability one airplane at a time, side by side with our regulator. This team is up to the challenge and will apply any and all resources to get back to deliveries that satisfy our customers and underwrite the long-term demand profile.\", \"We're still confident in the goals we laid out for '25, '26, although it may take longer in that window than originally anticipated, and we won't rush the system. With that, I'll turn it back to Dave for closing comments.\", 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah. Thanks, Brian. We're addressing you from Renton, home of the 737 MAX family. We're living in the here and now, and we're working with all of our people.\", \"And I couldn't be more impressed with their commitment, dedication, and the comprehensive nature around which they will look at this. Boeing will get better. I am confident in that. We will address everything that needs to be learned from the accident, and we'll move forward.\", 'So, thanks. Happy to take your questions.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question is from the line of Peter Arment. Please go ahead.', 'Peter Arment -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', 'Yeah. Good morning, Dave and Brian.', 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Hi, Peter.', 'Peter Arment -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', \"Dave, thanks for the initial open color on the MAX situation and the steps being taken. So, I guess just to follow on that, Dave, I wanted to ask you about where you assess you are in kind of the recovery of the MAX program when we think about what has been a successful transition to rate 38 and some of the progress in stabilizing the supply chain, and you've commenced deliveries to China. And I know we're not talking about '25, '26 targets, but directionally, there's been a lot of improvements since last fall and since your Investor Day when you laid out this long-term outlook. Thanks.\", 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah. Peter, I appreciate that. By the way, one stat which I was just handed which I track all the time is the number of our -9s that have been returned into service. We're at 129.\", \"And that is progressing at a very quick rate based on the inspection protocols that our FAA and we all agreed with. I am very proud of the progress that we've made, and I feel great about it. Of course, with one exception, and it's too big an exception, which is the escape. I also know that as the NTSB investigation narrows and concludes, and I do believe that will happen in relatively short order, all the learning that can be extracted from it and all the learning that can be extracted from all those inspections of all those airplanes flying day in and day out, that will inform us on what improvements we can make on our quality systems.\", \"First and foremost, we will run the door plug literally from the second a door is received at Wichita through their lines, all 12 positions, through our 11 positions here. Inspections will be added at every turn. It is on lockdown. And we've had help from our FAA, we've had help from our customers, etc.\", \"So, that's sort of Step 2. The next one is how do you take all of that learning and apply it through all the supply chain lines? And we have some medium- and long-term efforts just beginning to make sure that we do that. My confidence comes from quality systems always can get better. And when you have a moment like this, you take everything.\", \"You literally look at everything. And we're all keenly aware of everything. So, we're going to run that play as hard as we can. And we're going to take the time to do it in the FAA.\", \"I'm sort of glad they called out a pause because that's a good excuse to just take our time, do it right. And I wish I had called that out on the first day, but maybe I would have. We've been good at taking pauses. I've probably taken more pauses in the last three years, and I'll apologize to all our investors now, than have been taken in 10 years before it.\", \"But this is what we do and it's how we get better. And I also say, Peter, as you know, one of the nagging issues that we've been facing have been shortages here and there where we have to pause our line. Buffer inventory is not quite as robust as we'd like them to be based on supply chain weaknesses. We will run our master schedule in accordance with the plans that preceded this.\", 'And each and every part we receive and all the buffer inventories that we get will stabilize production here on out. Less traveled work in our line. All things good come from that. So, I feel really good about it.', \"And I also have confidence in our airplanes that will be certified. I like the respect that the FAA and Boeing are showing one another. Again, I -- maybe too long a diatribe, but there are lots of sound reasons for why I'm feeling good. And in some ways, this moment will accelerate recovery, not delay it.\", 'Peter Arment -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', 'And just initial progress on China. Thanks.', 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah. So, Peter, as we've talked many, many, many times, we have stood by our customers in China day in and day out. They have been flying MAXs now for the better part of the year. They are performing extremely well.\", \"And we'd always hoped than expected they would begin to take deliveries. And I think everybody has noticed that those deliveries have started. So, we are just going to stay diligent and stay with each and every one of them and make sure our Chinese customers get what they've ordered and paid for.\", 'Peter Arment -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', 'Thanks so much, Dave.', 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Operator', 'Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.', 'Sheila Kahyaoglu -- Jefferies -- Analyst', \"Good morning, Dave and Brian. Maybe if you could update us on how you're thinking about the MAX 10 and the MAX 7 certification timing just given the MAX 7 exemption being withdrawn. What does it mean for the 10 and how does that phase in as you think about ramping production to 50 a month and the profit profile of the MAX line if there's no MAX 7 or 10?\", 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', \"Sheila, thanks for that question. I'm going to just give a little bit of a moment on why we made that decision on the time-limited exemption. I'll let Brian help quantify it. I visited Capitol Hill for a lot of reasons.\", \"My biggest one is to own the problem, be transparent, and convey that to all of our workforce so that they know we're willing to do that and then we can all be honest, clear with each other every step of the way in this process. And I'm -- so I'm glad I made the visit. I was not expecting, when I met with Senator Duckworth, the conversation that we had. You know she's a pilot and a decorated pilot.\", \"She listened to everything I had to say. We didn't have a debate about the safety of the 7. And the 7 in its certification work was moving along at a pretty steady pace. She had a way different argument for me, and it was right.\", \"She said, you want to introduce this new airplane? A derivative, yes, but a new airplane. And nine months from now, you'll have an engineered solution to it, to this issue. And why is that the right call? And in my view, it was a sound, principled position to take. I went home for the weekend.\", 'I talked to our customer. You know who that is. Unbelievably constructive. And this is the right thing to do and for aviation.', \"So, that is really how it happened. And it was that simple. But the passion and the argument that Senator Duckworth presented to me, I'm so glad I heard. Anyway, that's what happened.\", \"The 7 will have to move until we get that engineered fix in place. And then I'll let Brian sort of quantify the, OK, now what?\", 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', \"Yeah. And on the 7, the work at hand, we will design an engineering solution. We're applying the resources. Our view is that that could be within a year.\", \"But on the 7, remember, while it's very, very important customer, the number of deliveries you're talking about is relatively small. As I mentioned, we've got 35 of -7 and -10s in inventory at the end of the quarter. There's a handful of 10s. They're mostly 7s.\", \"So -- but we'll sort that out as the process works and that airplane, per the FAA, gets certified. On your question on the -10, you know, I prefer not to get into what-ifs. It is a great airplane. Customers love it, and there's great demand for it.\", \"And it'll get certified at some point when the FAA decides.\", 'Sheila Kahyaoglu -- Jefferies -- Analyst', 'OK. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question is from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.', 'Myles Walton -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', \"Thanks. Brian, you alluded to 2024 being another, I think the words were steady year of free cash flow. I think in sort of follow-on descriptions, you gave a lot of uppers to what's going to happen year on year. So, is steady meaning growth in free cash flow, and/or can you give some of the offsets to the uppers? Thanks.\", 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah. Thanks, Myles. So, I did describe some of the key ones. Obviously, BCA volume up.', \"BDS less of a drag. BGS steady. There's a big investment in there that probably should have called out now that you're asking. It's a 777X investment.\", \"That's important and that's big. And also, we got a plan for, you know, making sure that we stay laser-like our supply based on the master schedule. We don't want them to take their foot off on what they're doing. And if that means we got to hold more inventory, so be it.\", \"It's important because, at this moment, it will allow us to have any of our suppliers that might have been at the line, might stand short of the line, they get a chance to catch up. So, all of that in the mix, our leverage that we got to deal with as we move into the year. And in terms of what steady means, you know, our belief, as we stand here today, the bottom end will look a lot like it did last year and maybe a little bit of growth. And once we know more, we'll put more specificity around it, and we'll give normal guidance when adequate and when appropriate.\", 'Myles Walton -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', 'OK. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question is from Seth Seifman from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.', 'Seth Seifman -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Hey. Thanks very much and good morning.', 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning, Seth.', 'Seth Seifman -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Brian, you talked a couple of times about the shadow factories and, you know, the path toward winding them down over the next year and change. Is there any way to quantify, you know, how you think about what the cost of those shadow factories was in 2023 or what you expect it to be in 2024?', 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', \"Yeah. So, thanks. I would -- the impact, you're not going to see in 2024 just because we still have to move that work through the system. But as we exit, it will be largely behind us.\", \"As we think about our expectations on BCA profitability over time, we've always talked to it getting back to normal. A lot of that productivity will be not only what volume might look like, can't say a lot about that now, but also we don't have this resource with the shadow factories. So, we won't quantify it specifically, but it is an important component as we think about going from what our profitability has looked like at BCA historically and where we think we can get to.\", 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', \"And maybe I'll just add and refresh everybody's memory because we've talked about it a couple of times. In our shadow factories, we put more hours into those airplanes than we do to produce it in the first place. So, anyway, that's -- I -- that's a metric I know everybody understands.\", 'Seth Seifman -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', \"Great. Maybe if I could sneak in one more to the advances. It was a nice tailwind in '23. You know, how do you think about that in '24?\", 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', \"You know, right now, you know, we plan for obviously not to be quite what it was in 2023. That's factored into my comments. The good news is, is that we still have a pretty robust demand environment, and our commercial teams are working hard to chase every next order. So, we're not counting on a big one, but we know that our teams can go win campaigns.\", 'Seth Seifman -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Thanks very much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. The next question is from Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead.', 'Jason Gursky -- Citi -- Analyst', 'Hey. Good morning, everybody. Brian, just maybe a quick clarification, or maybe Dave, and then a question on defense. The clarification is on the rate of 38 a month.', \"Do you guys still firing some blanks so that the number that you're actually producing is a little bit less than that? Just kind of curious what rate 38 means. And then on defense, Brian, you've historically broken things down into that 60-25-15 bucket. You talked a little bit about the 25% bucket and 15% bucket in your remarks. I was wondering if you just comment on the 60%, the remaining part of the portfolio, and how that's performing, and where maybe margins are in that slug of business at this point.\", 'Thanks.', 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', \"Sure. I'll take the first one. Yeah, we've cycled to 38 per month. We said that.\", \"Keep in mind, it always takes time for that to equate into deliveries, but we're not firing blanks. On your question on the 60% of the portfolio on BDS. Look, you know, they've consistently quarter in and quarter out has still been able to deliver some very good performance on some products that the customers need. And you know the laundry list that we talked about, things like Apache and all that sort of stuff, missiles and weapons.\", \"Things that are needed right now in this environment that we live in. And they're performing well, and they're in that mid- to high-single-digit margin rate. And when we step back, if we think about going from where BDS is with margins, two things have to happen. That 25% that's wrapped around fighters and satellites, that has to get better.\", \"We still expected it to get better and look a lot like it used to. So then you've got 85% of your portfolio clicking at stable, consistent mid- to high single-digit rates. And we know we can get there. And then you've got this 15% of the portfolio on fixed-price development programs that we expect to be less of a drag as we retire risk over time.\", 'And we expect that to play out.', 'Jason Gursky -- Citi -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Your next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead.', 'Doug Harned -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', 'Good morning. Thank you.', 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. Hi, Doug.', 'Doug Harned -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', \"Hi. I want to go back to the MAX 7 and the MAX 10 certification. And the question I have is when you look forward and given there is uncertainty on the timing of the certification of each one of those and you look at both the mix and your customer demand. And certainly, you've had, you know, more demand than you can respond to given supply chain issues.\", \"First, let's say that mix changes because of the timing of certification on those two variants. Are you still -- do you still see your line as full because it could be moved around between -7s, 8s, 9s, 10s? And then second, what kind of operational challenges, if any, do you have when you have to have some flexibility about what variant you're producing?\", 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', \"You know, Doug, I'll just start by saying I think it's manageable. We will have -- this -- if there's a delay in any way, we're not going to know at the last second. We're going to know with a considerable time frame, in my view. And by the way, right now, the status on 7 and the 10 was progressing reasonably well.\", \"I don't believe the FAA has taken anybody off the course, and we haven't taken anybody off the course. And so, they are making real progress. And I think we were almost close to the finish line had we not pulled, you know, the time-limited exemption. So, I don't -- again, I'm never going to suggest a date or anything like that for the FAA, but they're working diligently on it, and they know how to separate these two -- these -- the issue we're wrestling with in our factory from the cert efforts.\", \"And I believe we're going to have plenty of time, and we'll be able to manage our product mix reasonably well. There won't be anything dramatic by way of change. If there are some subtle changes from quarter to quarter, first or second, you'll know it pretty early and so will we. And I think it's quite manageable.\", 'Doug Harned -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', 'So, is it fair to say that the supply chain ramp is probably still the governing constraint on your production ramp, not things like mix here?', 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', \"Yes. Although, I will say, if this pause goes on for a little while, you know, I don't like -- I don't want to pause my customers. But the pause is going to be helpful for us in so many ways in the sense that that supply chain, they're going to keep running according to that master schedule. It's good for us if some buffers get developed and some of the more stressed suppliers get ahead of the game.\", 'So, there is important progress that will get made despite this momentary pause.', 'Doug Harned -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', 'Very good. Thank you.', 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. Thanks, Doug.', 'Operator', 'The next question is from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.', 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Hey, Ron.', 'Ron Epstein -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Yeah. Good morning. Hey. Good morning.', \"How are you? If I may, I have, like, a two-part question, if that's OK. Yeah, the first one, if you guys could walk through 787 a little bit. You mentioned the rate. What's going on in that line, that sort of thing? We get questions about that.\", \"And then I'll come back with the second part in a sec.\", 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', \"Yeah. So, on the 787, there's nothing new on the 87. Teams doing a very nice job. We'll produce at the five-per-month rate, like we described.\", \"We expect to steadily increase those rates over time and liquidate a lot of inventory. A lot of inventory. And, you know, we'll give more dimensions around the specifics in line with normal guidance. But the program is doing just fine, and the backlog is big.\", 'Ron Epstein -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', \"Yeah, it's been doing great. And then maybe the second question, this one's maybe a little more difficult. The -- I'm still trying to get my head around how we got here, meaning, you know, if you go back to the beginning of the MAX issue, wasn't the 737 line like the most scrutinized production line in the world? So, I mean, what happened to get to where we got today? You know, I understand that, you know, revamping the quality system and all that. It's all great news.\", \"It's a positive move forward. But why did that have to happen now? And I just don't understand that.\", 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', \"Well, Ron, it's a -- it should never happen. So, the question about now is that not so relevant? It should never and can never happen. I am incredibly proud of the work that our people do on the 37 line. I think it has steadily progressed.\", 'Quality numbers have gotten better. But then when you have an escape and then when everybody concludes exactly what happened in that escape, that lights another fire. So, you take another step forward with respect to all things quality. And you make certain that whatever it was that created that opportunity for failure in the sky or in flight can never happen again.', \"And that has already happened. And then we'll learn from everything. So, yeah, I think I understand your underlying context for the question, but I probably take exception to that premise.\", 'Ron Epstein -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Operator', 'The next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.', 'Cai von Rumohr -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', \"Yes. Thanks so much. So, now that you've waived the exemption on the engine anti-icing and your redesign -- you're designing the new system, you said it would take about a year. Have you accelerated that at all and could you accelerate it more because my assumption is that is going to be the long pole in the tent in terms of when you -- when the FAA can certify the MAX 7 and 10?\", 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', \"I think that is an accurate statement that you just made given the fact that we made this decision just a couple of days ago. Needless to say, we will throw more engineers at it. We're going to put more work into it. And I hope we can accelerate it.\", \"And the nine months that I discussed with Senator Duckworth was based on my understanding of that project before I made this decision. So, the answer is yes. We'll step up resources. We'll step up whatever testing is required.\", \"We will do everything we can to inform the FAA about that particular part of that program. So -- and that's where we stand today. And you are correct. That is the pole in the tent all of us should be watching.\", 'Cai von Rumohr -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', \"Terrific. Thank you. And then another quick one. You know, with the supply chain running at the master schedule but you're delivering not quite as many, should we think about a fairly large build in the inventory account here in the next couple of quarters until you get beyond that?\", 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', \"Yeah. There's two things, Cai, that are going to be things we have to deal with in cash flow. One is going to be the 777X investment I discussed, as well as what you just described. And that's contemplated in my description of what we thought the bottom look like.\", \"And then we just got to go run the play and, you know, work through what's in front of us. But more work ahead, and we'll describe it more specifically as we move through the year.\", 'Cai von Rumohr -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Matt Welch -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'Hey, Lois, we have time for one more question.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And that question will come from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.', 'Noah Poponak -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Hey. Good morning, everyone.', 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Hey, Noah.', 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Hi, Noah.', 'Noah Poponak -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', \"Might go over one if I'm last, but, Brian, recognizing that there are some limitation here in how you can discuss it, but maybe just trying to talk out MAX units this year with assumptions of not breaking to higher rates. You know, you made it a point to say you're at 38. I know, you know, that rate final assembly where the entire supply chain is is always a different number. But, you know, if I just simply said 31 for six months and 38 for six months, that's in the low 400s.\", 'And then you unwind five to 10 of inventory a month. You know, I can kind of get, you know, somewhere near a 500 or just decent growth from 2023. Is that just a reasonable starting point as we wait to learn more from the FAA?', 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', \"You know, Noah, I completely understand the question. Those are the inputs I described. But, you know, I -- out of respect for the process that we need to go through with the FAA, I just got to steer away from specificity. It's just not the right time.\", \"We've got work in front of us. And I promise, when appropriate, we are going to be more specific. But anyway, that's -- it's probably going to be on the specificity of those numbers, wait and see. It's just not appropriate.\", 'Noah Poponak -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Yup. Fair enough. Fair enough. Are you willing and able to speak to just updating what the cap is these days on the monthly inventory unwind and how China plays into that?', 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', \"I don't know if we think about a cap. We've got these shadow factories that have been working for, you know, quite a while, and they know the routines and they've been pretty steadily on both 37 and the 87, consistently meeting month-in and month-out liquidation targets and expectations for customers. So, I don't think there's any kind of cap. We're just focused on -- we know exactly the pile of inventory.\", \"It's 140 on the 37 that I described. It's 50 on the 87 that have to get the rework. And we're just going to move through this year with real focus in order to be at a position where we start shutting these shadow factories down. And then we're just going to run that play as hard as we can.\", 'Noah Poponak -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', \"OK. And is China officially fully 100% taking deliveries? We see it in the press. We see the reading of the tail number websites. But can you just declare that that's just fully officially on at this point?\", 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'One at a time. And yes.', 'Noah Poponak -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', \"OK. And then, Brian, just one more defense. You know, the margins still not where you want it, but better sequentially. Any framework you can provide around how that progresses through '24? And what was the final defense cash burn in the '23 cash so we can think about where -- you know, what to work off of as we go into '24?\", 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', \"Yeah. So, the cash burn, we put out some numbers a year ago, and we thought the operating cash flows by division. BDS, the worst-case end for them in that range, they were much worse than that. And it's all what we've described last year, and we expect it to be better this year, and that's behind us.\", 'But yet, they did a lot worse. Obviously, offset by BGS and BCA doing better. But it was worse. And then the first part of your question on margins, you know, we expect margin trajectories to get better over time, particularly as we focus on this 25% of the portfolio.', \"That is very specific and there's a lot of actions or activity around it. But we will get better. They will eventually get to the point where we're putting positives on the board. What I'm most interested is the team has got to execute over the next -- between now and 2025, '26 in order to get these margins back in the high-single-digit range.\", \"And I will remind you that that's how we describe our defense margins. You really got to put 2 points on top of that, which is what we account for in our global services division for the defense side. So, it's really looking more like a double-digit defense external view that we are aiming to get toward because we think that's a pretty decent business.\", 'Noah Poponak -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Right. OK.', 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'And you squeezed in three.', 'Noah Poponak -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'We got in. We got them all in. Got the rest in.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy On Sale.', 'Travel demand around the world has started surprising pre-pandemic levels, leading to an increase in demand for aircrafts that has benefited aerospace stocks. Geopolitical upheavals in Europe and the Middle East have also served to boost the aerospace industry as countries look to bolster their defense arsenals. These trends, observed over the past few months, are likely to continue into 2024, providing a tailwind for aerospace stocks like The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) that are presently trading at discounted prices.', 'According to a report by research firm Deloitte, aerospace companies will face challenges such as supply chain issues, longer lead times, and a talent shortage as the demand outlook for the industry improves. Digital transformation as a whole, and the integration of artificial intelligence into products in particular for enhanced productivity, real-time data synchronization, and simplified customization processes will also be a key trend shaping the industry moving forward. Consulting firm PwC estimates that the aerospace and defense sector generated revenues of more than $741 billion in 2022, up from $714 billion in 2021.', 'Even though this represents a 3% increase in revenue year-on-year, a closer look at the number reveals that the operating margins for the industry increased by 8% during this time. Despite higher demand, the revenues for the top six defense contractors in 2022 were down by 3%, largely due to the supply chain issues and labor constraints. Investors should also closely monitor the development of sustainable propulsion technologies in the aerospace sector as the industry focuses on reducing carbon emissions. Leading defense contractors in the United States are likely to be at the forefront of this endeavor.', 'Dave Calhoun, the CEO of The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), recently said during the third quarter earnings call that his company is focused on improving operating margins in the aerospace and defense sector. He added that engineering changes were a key part of this process which would support better installations. The CEO also noted that the firm would hold important supplier negotiations over the course of the next few months. However, he stressed that none of these changes would impact the overall performance of the company and the capability to deliver end products.', \"“In defense and space, we still have more work to improve operating performance. Results this quarter were impacted by higher estimated costs on the VC-25B program. We are maturing through this build process, incorporating engineering changes to better support the installation process, and we resolved important supplier negotiations over the course of the quarter. I'll note that none of these items will impact the performance and capability of the end product.\", \"The increased estimates reflect the process by which we build the airplanes. And in a fixed-priced environment, any unplanned hurdles can introduce unrecoverable costs. At the end of the day, we have two airplanes to build. We're getting past these hurdles and are committed to delivering two exceptional airplanes for our customers.\", \"Separately, as you saw, we are also expecting higher costs on a satellite program as we build out the constellation and meet our light cycle commitments for our customer. We're working on real innovation and advanced capabilities in this space and see real potential market as we deliver against this commitment. More broadly, across BDS, we're stabilizing operations and taking comprehensive actions to improve performance, including lean initiatives, contracting disciplines, factory improvements, engineering investments, and more. We're seeing some early signs of progress, but financial improvement at BDS' lower volumes takes time.”\", 'Our Methodology', 'Aerospace stocks that have registered a decrease of 4% or more in share price over the past month were selected and ranked according to hedge fund sentiment.

      "['January Jobs Week continues this morning, even as we’re only just closing out the month today. Private-sector payrolls reported by Automatic Data Processing ADP came in below estimates: 107K versus 150K expected, and beneath the previous month’s downwardly revised 158K. We’ve now spent a full six months sub-200K private-sector job gains per month. Typically, the breakdown was 30K new private-sector jobs in goods producing and 77K in services.Based on company size, small firms (fewer than 50 employees) gained +25K new jobs in the private sector this month, while large companies (500 or more employees) grew +31K. Medium-sized employers led the month with 61K new private-sector hires. Unsurprisingly, Leisure  Hospitality led all industries with +28K new jobs filled (many times lower than we were seeing from this sector a couple years ago), followed by Trade/Transportation/Utilities at +23K and Construction +22K. Interestingly, Info Tech dropped -9K for the month — though this aligns with reported layoffs at Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL and Salesforce CRM, among others.Another aspect of this ADP data is in its recent tracking of wage growth among employees who stay at their current jobs versus those who find employment elsewhere: these figures are +5.2% and +7.2%, the lowest they’ve been since the waning months of the Covid pandemic. These are the kinds of data points the Fed is looking for, by the way, when it decides on whether to cut interest rates based on disinflationary economic data.Speaking of the Fed, its latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting concludes this afternoon, with a new statement released on interest rate policy. Virtually no one expects to see a move from the 5.25-5.50% Fed funds rate that has been in effect since late July 2023. This will be followed by a press conference and QA with Fed Chair Jerome Powell in the 1pm hour ET. It will be interesting to hear the Fed’s forecast based on this modestly shrinking labor market results from ADP this morning.Meanwhile, Boeing BA outperformed expectations in its Q4 earnings report this morning, to -$0.47 per share from -$0.72 expected (and the -$1.75 per share reported in the year-ago quarter). However, the aerospace major has suspended forward guidance for 2024, based on the fate of its 737 MAX fleet, which saw a fuselage panel blowout on a recent flight. We’re also four years into the tenure of CEO Dave Calhoun (who took over following two 737 MAX crashes in late 2018 and early 2019), where Boeing has reported 10 earnings misses in the past 14 quarters. Shares are up nearly +2% on the Q4 news.Diabetes and weight-loss drug specialist Novo Nordisk NVO, the Denmark-based maker of Ozempic, Rybelsus, Wegovy and many others, also outperformed expectations on both top and bottom lines: earnings of 71 cents per share outpaced the Zacks consensus by 5 cents (and well above the 42 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter), while revenues of $9.51 billion swept past the $9.14 billion analysts were looking for. Ozempic rose +85% in the quarter, while weight-loss treatments Saxenda and Wegovy together grew +114% in the quarter. Shares are up +2.3% on the news in today’s pre-market.

We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into the company's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

Core earnings/(loss) per share is defined as GAAP\\xa0Diluted earnings/(loss) per share\\xa0excluding the net earnings/(loss) per share impact of the\\xa0FAS/CAS service cost adjustment\\xa0and\\xa0Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses.

CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. Management uses core operating earnings/(loss), core operating margin and core earnings/(loss) per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as they exclude non-service pension and post-retirement costs, which primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to government contracts.

Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders, debt repayment, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt.

The non-GAAP financial information presented excludes certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into the company's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following definitions are provided:\", 'Core Operating Earnings/(loss), Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings/(loss) Per Share', 'Core operating earnings/(loss) is defined as GAAP Earnings/(loss) from operations excluding the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core operating margin is defined as Core operating earnings/(loss) expressed as a percentage of revenue. Core earnings/(loss) per share is defined as GAAP Diluted earnings/(loss) per share excluding the net earnings/(loss) per share impact of the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. Management uses core operating earnings/(loss), core operating margin and core earnings/(loss) per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as they exclude non-service pension and post-retirement costs, which primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to government contracts. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided on page 12 and page 13.', 'Free Cash Flow', 'Free cash flow is GAAP\\xa0operating cash flow reduced by capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders, debt repayment, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses free cash flow as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity. See Table 2 on page 2 for reconciliation of free cash flow to GAAP operating cash flow.', 'Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements', 'This press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Boeing simultaneously became a financial basket case, losing more than $26 billion, and counting, over the last five years, with no end to the red ink in sight.', 'Boeing executives insist that quality and safety are still a top priority for the company, and the problems of recent years have only increased its focus on quality and safety. Asked for comment on the claim that it now puts profits ahead of quality and safety, the company pointed to a recent statement by CEO Dave Calhoun.', '“Over the last several years, we’ve added rigor around our quality processes, hired tens of thousands of engineers and mechanics, advanced key investments in our future, transformed our functions and gradually increased our production rates,” he told investors in October. “Most importantly, we’ve worked hard to instill a culture of speaking up and transparently bringing forward any issue, no matter the size, so we can get things right for the future.”', 'A week after Calhoun made the remark, the company delivered a 737 Max 9 to Alaska Air, the fourth it had built for the carrier that month.

And it spun-off some of the operations it had depended upon previously. Supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which builds the fuselages for Boeing’s planes, including the 737 Max, was created in 2005 after Boeing sold its Wichita division and Oklahoma operations raising $900 million in cash by doing so.', 'And in 2009, about a year after weathering a 58-day strike at its unionized plants in Washington state, the company announced plans for a non-union plant in right-to-work South Carolina to assemble its new, most advanced jet, the 787 Dreamliner, giving it a factory with lower pay that wasn’t at risk of going on strike in the future.', 'Calhoun, Boeing’s current CEO, took over in January 2020, nine months into the grounding of the 737 Max following two fatal crashes. He also has no engineering background, having served as senior managing director and head of portfolio operations at investing firm The Blackstone Group, CEO of Nielsen and spending 26 years at GE.', 'Just over a year and a half later, after the pandemic reduced demand for the long-range Dreamliner due to the drop in international travel, Calhoun and Boeing decided it needed to\\xa0preserve cash\\xa0and could no longer justify two 787 plants. It had a choice between consolidating production to a veteran plant in Washington state staffed by unionized employees and a non-union South Carolina plant.

He told CNN his frustration with top management attitudes on quality led him to quit.', 'In 2019 he testified to Congress that there was evidence that the 737 Max was having production quality issues, including planes being delivered to airlines that had faulty hardware or other system malfunctions, problems that involved more than a dozen safety issues, some of which he described as serious. He recounted that he had recommended a halt in production of the 737 Max to deal with quality issues in the months ahead of the first crash. He said the boss to whom he had made the recommendation told him, “We can’t do that, I can’t do that.”', 'Related article', 'A terrifying 10 minute flight adds to years of Boeing’s quality control problems', '“I pushed back, explaining that I had seen operations in the military shut down over less substantial safety issues, and those organizations had national security responsibilities,” he testified. He said his supervisor responded tersely, “The military isn’t a profit-making organization.”', 'Other experts agree with Pierson that despite its claims of being concerned with safety and quality, Boeing’s actions suggest otherwise.', '“You’re looking at a management team whose idea of acknowledging the problem is to readjust the cash flow numbers for next year,” said Aboulafia in an interview with CNN.', 'And then disaster struck.', 'The first fatal\\xa0crash of a 737 Max\\xa0occurred\\xa0in Indonesia in October 2018, the\\xa0second in Ethiopia in March 2019, killing a total of 346 people. It led to a 20-month grounding of all 737 Max jets. In addition to the horrifying loss of life, it cost the company more than $21 billion, making it one of the costliest corporate disasters on record, as well as one of the most deadly.', 'After the first crash, Boeing successfully pushed to keep the planes in the air. Even after the second crash, as airline regulators around the world\\xa0grounded the jet, Boeing pushed the FAA to hold off on its own grounding order, saying that it had “full confidence in the safety\\xa0of the 737 Max” and that “based on the information currently available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance” to airlines.', 'When the FAA gave in to\\xa0global and public pressure to announce its\\xa0own grounding, Boeing said it accepted the move out of an “abundance of caution.”', 'Eventually it was a design flaw in the Max that was blamed for the two fatal crashes, as a feature meant to stop the planes from climbing too fast and stalling instead forced the nose of the planes downward.', 'But critics of Boeing say the problem wasn’t just the flawed design of the jet that led to the deaths, it was the decisions that Boeing made to not quickly acknowledge the problem with design after the first crash, and have a grounding take place at that time, which could have prevented the second crash.', '“In the light most favorable to Boeing, the first crash was an accident, the second crash is a crime,” said Robert Clifford, the attorney suing Boeing on behalf of families of the victims of the second crash, the one in Ethiopia, in an interview with CNN. He said if the plane had been grounded immediately, Boeing might have ended up fixing the problem much faster, and with less expense, as well as preventing the second crash.', '“They gambled with people’s lives and the people lost,” he said.', 'In 2021 Boeing admitted to liability in the two crashes, agreeing to pay compensatory damages, which allowed the company to avoid the possibility of having to pay far more in punitive damages.', '“Boeing is committed to ensuring that all families who lost loved ones in the accidents are fully and fairly compensated for their loss,” the company said in a statement at that time. “By accepting responsibility, Boeing’s agreement with the families allows the parties to focus their efforts on determining the appropriate compensation for each family.”', 'It has also agreed to pay a $2.5 billion fine to settle charges it defrauded\\xa0the FAA when it first won approval of the flawed 737 Max.', '“I firmly believe that entering into this resolution is the right thing for us to do — a step that appropriately acknowledges how we fell short of our values and expectations,” Calhoun said at that time.', 'But that agreement was criticized by the families of victims of the Ethiopian air crash as well as members of Congress as being far too lenient. About 70% of the $2.5 billion fine it agreed to pay was money it had already agreed to pay as compensation to its airline customers.', 'Pierson said the probe that followed the second crash revealed\\xa0Boeing executives\\xa0were more concerned with continued production than finding the cause of the crash and fixing it.', '“They absolutely prioritized the delivery of planes over the investigation,” he said.', 'Pierson said the design flaw, as problematic as it was, was not the total problem that led to the crash. He said the quality of the work that would produce various malfunctions while the planes were in flight was just as significant as the design flaw.', 'He points to a report from the Ethiopian Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau that looked at both fatal crashes and found that “These accidents were triggered by production quality defects that… presented as intermittent system malfunctions.”', 'Without the build quality issues causing malfunctions, the design flaw feature of the plane that forced the nose of the plane down would not have turned on, and the flights would not have crashed, according to the Ethiopian report.', 'But that finding got little attention as the US National Transportation Safety Board and the FAA focused on design flaws rather than the build\\xa0quality issues, Pierson said.', 'Eventually the probe provided an ugly look at the\\xa0decision-making process\\xa0at Boeing. Internal communications released during the 737 Max grounding showed one employee describing the jet as “designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.”', 'Boeing’s release of the documents included an apology to the FAA, Congress, airlines, and the public.', 'An ironic part of Boeing’s focus on profits is that it has resulted in a company that is\\xa0in the worst financial shape in its more than 100-year history, with five years of deep losses already,\\xa0and more expected losses ahead.', 'As recently as 2018 Boeing was riding high, reporting revenue of more than $100 billion for the first time in its history and projecting more growth to come. It had just started deliveries of the 737 Max the year before. The short-term focus on profits was, indeed, producing profits. At least for a little while.', 'Its rival Airbus was the one struggling, on the verge of abandoning its $25 billion mistake, the A380 superjumbo jet that had turned out to be a white elephant with little demand from airlines or passengers. Despite that, the two companies were neck-and-neck in orders and deliveries.', 'But in less than a decade, all that has changed.', 'Airbus delivered 735 commercial jets last year. Boeing only 528. Net orders and the backlog of jets each is waiting to build show a larger imbalance. And while Airbus is forecast to report adjusted net income of $4.3 billion euros, or $4.7 billion profit, for 2023 when it reports results, Boeing is forecast to report a loss of $3.6 billion next week.', 'Aboulafia said the short-sighted push for profits has put the company at\\xa0a severe competitive disadvantage to Airbus, and that Calhoun and other top managers at Boeing, as well as its board, need to go if the company is to have a chance to turn things around.', 'Despite the losses and severely weakened market position of Boeing, there is little chance it could go out of business.', 'The airlines around the world that have already bought Boeing planes basically need to keep using those models, whatever the problems.', 'Commercial pilots are certified on specific models\\xa0and are not able to easily move\\xa0from single-aisle to widebody versions of Boeing jets, let alone between a Boeing and an Airbus jet. And having different models means the airlines need to have a large, expensive supply of spare parts on hand to keep their planes in the air.', 'And any Boeing customer who canceled their orders today would have to get in line behind a backlog of more than 8,600 jets that Airbus has already agreed to build for its existing customers.', '“It’s a very weird industry. It has high barriers to entry and only two players. You can get away with nonsense like this,” said Aboulafia.', 'Pierson said incident reports on planes that Boeing continues to build, while not nearly as dramatic as the Alaska Air incident, suggest the\\xa0pressure to put profits over quality remains, despite Boeing’s claims.', '“The company has gutted quality control so they can produce more airplanes,” he said. “The employees are completely overwhelmed. Everybody is focused on the Max 9, and rightfully so. That incident should never have happened. But there are issues on other planes. It has become a recipe for disaster.”', 'Most stock quote data provided by BATS. US market indices are shown in real time, except for the SP 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

The action, which is captioned State of Rhode Island Office of the General Treasurer, on behalf of the Employees’ Retirement System of the State of Rhode Island v. The Boeing Company, No. 24-cv-00151 (E.D.

Its Commercial Airplanes Segment is a leading producer of commercial aircraft and offers a family of commercial jetliners including its 737 MAX. Approximately five years ago, two Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes were involved in fatal crashes caused by malfunctions due to design flaws in the 737 MAX’s flight control software. The first crash occurred in October 2018 and the second crash occurred in March 2019 killing a total of 346 people and leading to 737 MAX planes being grounded from March 2019 to December 2020.', 'The Class Period starts on October 23, 2019, when Defendants boasted that Boeing was making progress towards the safe return to service of the 737 MAX. Throughout the Class Period, Defendants continued to assure investors that Boeing was laser-focused on safety and quality. Defendants also claimed that Boeing did not make trade-offs between safety and profit, and that safety was Boeing’s priority.', 'Unbeknownst to investors, statements such as those above were false and misleading because Boeing failed to disclose that it had been prioritizing its profits over safety, which led to poor quality control standards in the production of its commercial aircrafts such as the 737 MAX, resulting in a heightened risk of manufacturing flaws which could render the Company’s new airplanes unsafe. This very risk had materialized during the Class Period. These false and misleading statements caused Boeing stock to trade at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period.', 'It took a near disaster to expose this heightened safety risk. The public first learned about it on January 5, 2024 when a panel called a “door plug” flew out of the side of a 737 MAX 9 (a variant of 737 MAX) during Alaska Airlines Flight 1282. This left a gaping hole in the plane’s main cabin, feet from where passengers were sitting. Over the next few weeks, investigations into the incident continued and problems with such door plugs on other 737 MAX planes were discovered including loose bolts holding the door plugs in place, further revealing the Company’s manufacturing and production missteps and leading to the grounding of many 737 MAX 9 planes.

Reported EPS is $0.07 EPS, expectations were $0.35. RYAAY isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\", 'Michael O’Leary: Okay. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. You’re all very welcome to the Q3 results call. As you see earlier this morning on our ryanair.com website, we published our Q3 results together with an MDA and a QA section with myself and CFO, Neil Sorahan. A couple of quick themes. As you see, we reported a Q3 profit after tax of €15 million. Traffic and fares were ahead of the prior year, but closing Christmas and New Year loads and yields were softer than previously expected, as we had to lower prices somewhat in response to the very sudden, but surprising but very welcome removal of flights from most of the major OTA pirate websites in early December. Profit after tax, however, for the 9 months ended 31 December was up 39% at €2.19 billion.', 'Prior year, it was €1.58 billion. Just to touch on some brief Q3 highlights. The traffic grew 7% to 41 million. Revenue per passenger was up 9%. Average fares were up 13%, mainly due to a very strong Christmas and the October bank holiday weekend and ancillary revenues up 2%. MSCI raised their ESG rating on Ryanair from a BBB to an A in December. Our fuel bill rose €320 million in the quarter, up 35% to €1.2 billion. At the quarter end, we had 136 B737 Gamechangers in the total fleet that was significantly behind the original deliveries due to Boeing delays. More importantly, going forward, our fuel hedging, we’ve extended fuel hedging. We have 65% of our FY ‘25 fuel now hedged at $79 per barrel. This year, we are hedged at $89 per barrel.', 'So we have already banked a saving of €450 million into FY ‘25. And as you will all be aware, we have ended the first interim dividend of €0.175 per share is payable on the February 28. I think just to touch on growth in fleet. At the end of Q3, we’ve taken delivery of 136 737 Gamechangers. We now expect to have up to 174 of these aircraft in our fleet by the end of June in time for peak summer 2024, that’s up 50 aircraft from summer 2023. That would still be 7 aircraft short of our contracted deliveries due to Boeing delivery delays. However, those new aircraft means we have a bumper summer 2024 schedule now on sale. It includes 169 new routes, our first 11 domestic routes in Morocco and our first summer with 23 routes in Albania, are in to and from Tirana, the capital city of Albania.', 'While travel demand remains high, we expect summer ‘24 EU short-haul capacity to be behind where it was in summer ‘23 as a considerable number of our competitors ground the A320 aircraft in Europe due to the Pratt  Whitney engine issues and Boeing delivery delays constrain our growth from 57 to 50 aircraft. We are continuing to work closely with Boeing to minimize delivery delays and we have invested in additional engineering over – Ryanair engineering oversight to improve the quality control in both Wichita and Seattle. The recent MAX 9 grounding was a disappointing setback, but we welcome the ungrounding of the MAX 9 last week. Ryanair do not operate any MAX 9 variant. There are no MAX 9 aircraft in Europe, and therefore, it is largely a U.S. issue.', 'However, Neil visited in Seattle in January, met with Boeing’s senior management and we urge them and they have agreed to increase their quality assurance resources on the ground in Wichita and Seattle. We are putting more engineers into Wichita and Seattle to run extra checks on our deliveries, but also on our recent 737 deliveries, we’ve noted improvements in the quality with fewer delivery defects on the 12 aircraft we got in the fourth quarter before Christmas. However, we do believe Boeing have more work to do to improve quality and reduce delivery delays. But – and I want to stress this, we are fully supportive of the initiatives that David Calhoun and Brian West are taking to improve Boeing’s performance and production. It is critical, we believe, to Boeing’s continued performance that we support Calhoun and West.', 'I think they are a good team. I have concerns about the management in Seattle, but I have a lot of confidence in Calhoun and Brian West. I think they are on the right track. The MAX 9 grounding was an unfortunate event, and it does indicate that quality does need to be improved in Boeing, but we are very supportive and a lot of confidence in what Calhoun is doing under his leadership. We welcome – on the OTAs, this is a significant event in December. The timing of the OTA taking, as I said, was a bit unfortunate, because it was the first week in December. With Christmas coming, you can’t just go in and open up and dump seats to counteract that. We think historically, these OTA pirates generally account for between 10% and 15% of our volume.', 'So a sudden removal of that meant, we saw a sudden – or a very short-term dip in our bookings. We would normally respond to that by opening up price promotions, but we didn’t want to do that in the run into Christmas. We therefore think we’ll take a hit of 1% or 2% on load factor in December and January. We will take it into hit on yields during December and January, but we think it will be short-lived and we are happy with the forward bookings, particularly out into February and March, although March is slightly – is artificially enhanced by having the first half of Easter in that. Much more important for Ryanair and our passengers is to convert these OTA pirates into what we now would call kind of approved OTA partners. The partnership agreement we signed last week with loveholidays who were our fourth largest OTA and Kiwi.com this morning, who are our largest – where our largest OTA pirates, are critical, we think to protecting customers from OTA overcharges and scams.', 'As part of this agreement, we now give these two approved OTA direct feed of inventory from the ryanair.com website and they agree as part of the deal, no overcharging of passengers for either airfares or for any of our ancillaries. The bookings are made directly in the ryanair.com website with the customer’s actual and real e-mail address and real payment details, so that if we need to send a customer an e-mail or some flight information, it goes directly to the customer, it doesn’t get lost in some OTA pirate fake e-mail address. And whenever we have to refund to passengers, we can now make the bookings directly to the passengers. We think this is the way forward and we will continue to campaign to outlaw the illegal screen scraping and the customer overcharging and scamming being undertaken by so many others of these OTA pirates and converted them to the same system or the same mechanism that we now agree with loveholidays and Kiwi.', 'Looking forward to the summer 2024, we expect airlines will continue to consolidate. We expect capacity will be constrained by both the consolidation by the lack of aircraft deliveries post-COVID across Europe. And I think the A320 fleet grounding this summer, we expect about 10% of Europe’s A320 fleet to be grounded for the – while they address the Pratt  Whitney engine issues and that this will mean tight supply for summer 2024. And while we still have 50 additional aircraft into that marketplace, we don’t have the original 57 we had hoped for. So we think there is going to be a reasonably strong summer pricing. Already today, our bookings are running about 5% ahead of where they were, forward bookings into the summer about 5% ahead of where they were this time last year.', 'Pricing is up by a low single-digit percentage. Again, some of that, I think, is a factor of the fact that the first half of Easter has moved into March. So, Q4 is strong. But therefore, there is less of an impact of Easter pricing in April. But much work remains to be done, but we are very pleased with where we are for summer 2024. In terms of outlook, we are targeting 183.5 million passengers in the current year. That will still be a monumental achievement. The original budget was 185 million. But if you take the ATC – it’s been over 60 days of ATC strikes, that’s cost us over 1 million seats. The Tel Aviv cancellations, which have been running since the end of – since the end of November, that’s cost us about another 600,000 seats and the Boeing delivery delays have meant we’ve had to truncate both the summer 2024 – summer ‘23 schedule and our winter ‘24 schedule.', 'So, it will still be a very strong performance. However, as a result of these lower load factors, particularly in Q3 and the kicking in of some higher productivity pay agreements with pilot unions across Belgium, Italy and in the UK, these are productivity enhancements that we intend to rollout to most of the other by agreement with the other pilot unions and groups between now and summer 2024, which will significantly improve our operational resilience and reduce pilot attrition. We now expect full year ‘24 ex-fuel unit cost to rise by about €2.50. That would still leave a dramatically wider cost gap between Ryanair and our main European competitor airlines, two of whom reported last week. Q4, which is traditionally the weakest quarter will also be impacted by the partial unwind of free ETS carbon credits in the January 1, but we will benefit from a strong first half of Easter traffic falling into late March, although this is unlikely to offset the weaker than previously expected load factors and yields in late Q3 and early Q4.', 'We are therefore this morning narrowing our full year FY ‘24 profit after tax guidance to a range of between €1.85 billion to €1.95 billion. It was previously €1.85 billion to €2.05 billion. So we think the number will come in just under €2 billion for the full year. However, this guidance and the full year results still remains heavily dependent upon avoiding unforeseen adverse events in Q4, such as the Ukraine war, the Israel Hamas conflict and any further Boeing delivery delays, which might damage us in the run into Easter. We have also given you a full update or we have attached to the release, a full update on the OTA pirate situation. I think this has been one of the most dramatic victories for Ryanair in recent years. And I would always be happy to take a short-term pain if it’s getting rid of OTA pirate scamming and overcharging our customers and moving those into a more cooperative working with us.', 'It also, I think the new agreement this morning with loveholidays and with Kiwi exposes the falsehood of some of these OTA claims that Ryanair is just trying to eliminate OTA. We are not – we have, for many years, worked with OTAs like Google Flight who just – who are an honest price transparency website, but who send passengers directly to Ryanair to make the booking. The reason we have a problem with the OTA pirates is the illegal screen scraping of our digital – of our data and then using that to scam customers for excessive airfares, inflated ancillary services, and in some cases, charging them for non-existing services such as refund insurance and/or change fees, while it’s a non-changeable ticket. But I think it’s been a very good month or 2 months work and is long-term very much in Ryanair’s interest and in the interest of our consumers that they can get access to our low fares, our low cost ancillary services without being scammed by some intermediaries.', 'Neil, I am finished. Do you want to – anything you want to highlight in terms of the finances, the balance sheet and/or the dividend.', 'Neil Sorahan: Yes. I suppose just on the balance sheet, ended the quarter very strongly with just over €2.9 billion in gross cash and importantly, net cash balance €150 million. We continue to be the most highly rated airline in the world with a BBB+ rating from Fitch and SP. And a big advantage that we have in these markets is unencumbered Boeing 747 fleet, 546 unencumbered aircraft. And so we are generating net interest income in the business at a time when our competitors are refinancing or taking on expensive leases. So that’s a big competitive advantage that we have. You touched on the hedging, but I think we shouldn’t underestimate the benefit of the certainty that we have now in our hedging out to the end of March 2025, €450 million worth of savings being locked in and one are very volatile markets at this point in time.', 'And then, of course, we have got our first interim dividend at the end of next month, €0.175 per share and we’ll have something similar again after AGM approval in September. And that’s pretty much all I wanted to add, Michael.', 'Michael O’Leary: Okay. Alright.

      "['Paradoxically, just as Boeing is getting its planes back in the air, its challenges are only getting more serious. The FAA’s announcement last week–that while Boeing’s grounded 737 MAX 9 jets are finally returning to the skies, there will be a complete halt on any production increases for the entire 737 MAX program and any new regulatory approvals for additional MAX lines, most notably the MAX 7 and 10, which were reportedly nearing FAA approval right before the Alaska Air accident earlier this month–suggests that regulators are running out of patience for Boeing’s persistent quality control woes and are putting the foot down this time, demanding systemic fixes. Meanwhile, Boeing’s airline customers are in open revolt: United’s CEO Scott Kirby has already begun talks with Airbus about substituting A321 purchases for their formerly planned new 277 Boeing 737 Max 10 purchases.', 'We’ve often praised Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun for navigating deftly through a slew of inherited challenges, including guiding Boeing back to cash flow profitability out of COVID and the aerospace cyclical downturn, repairing damaged relations with regulators, restarting deliveries to China, and reducing high indebtedness–but we also presciently predicted last year that quality control flare-ups would prove persistent.', 'With the FAA putting Boeing on probation, and by extension, Calhoun on the hot seat, restoring Boeing’s credibility has become the embattled CEO’s single most important and urgent mandate. Having known the last six CEOs of Boeing personally going back three decades, and having closely observed Boeing through many life stages even before the McDonnell Douglas merger, here are three concrete steps Calhoun should take to revive Boeing’s safety culture, along with an accompanying slide deck of original data supporting our recommendations.', 'After the devastating 2019 MAX crashes that resulted in 376 deaths, the Boeing board established heightened safety processes, including a special five-person Aerospace Safety Subcommittee of the Board, as well as a Chief Aerospace Safety Officer within the company. Although four of the five members of the Safety Subcommittee are new board members with less than two years of experience (which is hardly surprising considering that 80% of Boeing’s board has turned over since 2019), their credentials are undoubtedly sterling, drawing across extensive aerospace sector experience. These include Subcommittee Chair and former CEO of GE Aviation David Joyce, former head of the U.S. Navy Adm. John Richardson, former CEO of Continental Airlines Lawrence Kellner, former Inspector General of the Air Force Gen. Stayce Harris, and Carrier Global CEO David Gitlin.', 'Yet the continued flare-up of safety issues means that something is evidently getting lost in translation between the board and the manufacturing and assembly lines–and the challenge runs much deeper than any single incident. How deeply the new quality control processes have permeated into Boeing’s production plants is an open question. One wonders whether safety-focused voices are sufficiently empowered internally, as one whistleblower report claimed that Boeing’s own quality control systems were routinely ignored with under-pressure line inspectors sometimes providing false or erroneous information, which would be consistent with long-running complaints of underinvestment and inadequate self-policing.', 'Calhoun’s appointment of an external safety expert to review Boeing’s safety processes is a step in the right direction–but the FAA appears to be pushing for more wholesale and permanent changes, including embedding FAA or third-party monitors directly across Boeing’s supply chain, unsatisfied with mere auditing.', 'By all appearances, Boeing has lost functional oversight and control over its suppliers, an issue that has been exacerbated by a lack of supply chain diversification and accountability. This is embodied by Boeing’s dysfunctional relationship with Spirit AeroSystems, which manufactures virtually all of Boeing’s fuselages.', 'For years, we have presciently and repeatedly warned about the latent risk posed by Spirit to Boeing’s operations, as the “soft underbelly” in the supply chain, and how former CEO Harry Stonecipher made a mistake by selling Spirit in 2005–but new whistleblower reports suggest that this dysfunctional marriage may be even worse than we appreciated.', 'According to a fresh report in the Seattle Times this week, citing an anonymous but credible whistleblower, Boeing engineers found no less than 392 instances of Spirit quality control failures over the last year. In one instance, Spirit’s engineers supposedly repaired the issues, only for the Boeing inspector to discover that Spirit merely “painted over” the problematic parts, forcing Boeing to do any further repairs in-house. Additional reports document how Spirit employees were encouraged not to report problems amidst a culture of fear, intimidation, and cost-cutting, with expert veteran engineers replaced by legions of cheaper and undertrained replacements. Boeing has refused to respond to media requests for comment, citing ongoing investigations. Meanwhile, Spirit has issued a statement saying that their primary focus is “the quality and product integrity of the aircraft structures” they deliver, adding that the company was working with Boeing on the matter and following regulators’ protocols.', 'Although the Spirit leadership ranks have almost completely turned over in the last four months amidst apparent pressure, and even if accomplished new CEO Pat Shanahan is committed to fixing Spirit’s process challenges, the last 20 years have shown that Spirit should not be a standalone company, period. No matter how much Boeing’s financial whiz kids resist the prospect of diluting Boeing’s prized free cash flow with Spirit’s low-margin, capital-intensive business, and wobbly balance sheet, one has to wonder whether a sum equivalent to 3% of Boeing’s market capitalization is worth all the operational headaches, especially as Boeing continues to inject hundreds of millions into Spirit to keep it afloat.', 'The silver lining here for Boeing is that almost all of its suppliers are heavily dependent on Boeing and thus, all are aligned and motivated to urgently fix these underlying, long-deferred structural challenges together. As the old Churchill saying goes, “Never let a good crisis go to waste.”', 'So far, Calhoun has won plaudits for his reassuring media interviews, all-staff meetings where he spoke about safety in personal terms as a father and grandfather, and desperately needed meetings with Congress in the days after the Alaska Air incident. Similarly, Calhoun was praised for letting his airline customers send inspectors to any Boeing or Spirit manufacturing plant in response to the public condemnations of major customers such as the CEOs of Hawaiian, United, and Ryanair.', 'But getting the MAX 9s back into the sky may have been the easy part. As the FAA digs in for protracted, intrusive oversight into Boeing’s internal process challenges in the months ahead, it will become progressively harder for Calhoun to control the narrative and continue fortifying public trust.', \"When Boeing faced similarly protracted regulatory reviews before, some of Calhoun's predecessors of were ill-advised to hide behind exceedingly vague, impersonal legalese in deference to regulators and investigators–which did not end well. This time around, Boeing’s challenge is even more acute since there will almost certainly need to be difficult but necessary tradeoffs in the months ahead. For example, even though Boeing has said repeatedly that building and delivering more MAXs is their top priority this year, many analysts consider it likely that Boeing will need to lower the lofty production and financial targets laid out merely months ago, and will likely need to withhold guidance during its highly anticipated earnings call on Wednesday. Some have also floated the prospect of internal reorganizations as accountability beckons.\", 'Now more than ever, Justice Louis Brandeis’ quip that “sunlight is the best disinfectant” rings true. Public safety and fortifying public trust must outweigh all short-term commercial impacts, no matter what investors or lawyers say. Needless market panic, employee confusion, and sensationalized speculation can be avoided if tough but necessary moves are packaged and perceived as a part of a broader strategic plan to restore Boeing’s credibility, rather than being seen as reactionary impulsiveness or palace intrigue.', 'Furthermore, showing an accountable human face of leadership–rather than hiding behind bureaucratic processes or delegating bad news to subordinates–can go a long way in making bad news more palatable.', 'Many airline executives are now joking that the old mantra, “if it’s not Boeing, I’m not going” will be at risk of turning into “if it’s Boeing, it’s not going” unless Boeing can revive its safety culture soon. Where Boeing goes from here will largely depend on whether they are seen as having safe planes in the clouds–or whether they are seen as having their own heads in the clouds.', 'Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is the Lester Crown Professor in Management Practice and Senior Associate Dean at Yale School of Management.

      "Travel demand around the world has started surprising pre-pandemic levels, leading to an increase in demand for aircrafts that has benefited aerospace stocks. Geopolitical upheavals in Europe and the Middle East have also served to boost the aerospace industry as countries look to bolster their defense arsenals. These trends, observed over the past few months, are likely to continue into 2024, providing a tailwind for aerospace stocks like The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) that are presently trading at discounted prices.\n",

Digital transformation as a whole, and the integration of artificial intelligence into products in particular for enhanced productivity, real-time data synchronization, and simplified customization processes will also be a key trend shaping the industry moving forward.

      "Even though this represents a 3% increase in revenue year-on-year, a closer look at the number reveals that the operating margins for the industry increased by 8% during this time. Despite higher demand, the revenues for the top six defense contractors in 2022 were down by 3%, largely due to the supply chain issues and labor constraints. Investors should also closely monitor the development of sustainable propulsion technologies in the aerospace sector as the industry focuses on reducing carbon emissions. Leading defense contractors in the United States are likely to be at the forefront of this endeavor.\n",

      "Aerospace stocks that have registered a decrease of 4% or more in share price over the past month were selected and ranked according to hedge fund sentiment.

      "January Jobs Week continues this morning, even as we’re only just closing out the month today. Private-sector payrolls reported by Automatic Data Processing ADP came in below estimates: 107K versus 150K expected, and beneath the previous month’s downwardly revised 158K. We’ve now spent a full six months sub-200K private-sector job gains per month. Typically, the breakdown was 30K new private-sector jobs in goods producing and 77K in services.Based on company size, small firms (fewer than 50 employees) gained +25K new jobs in the private sector this month, while large companies (500 or more employees) grew +31K. Medium-sized employers led the month with 61K new private-sector hires. Unsurprisingly, Leisure  Hospitality led all industries with +28K new jobs filled (many times lower than we were seeing from this sector a couple years ago), followed by Trade/Transportation/Utilities at +23K and Construction +22K. Interestingly, Info Tech dropped -9K for the month — though this aligns with reported layoffs at Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL and Salesforce CRM, among others.Another aspect of this ADP data is in its recent tracking of wage growth among employees who stay at their current jobs versus those who find employment elsewhere: these figures are +5.2% and +7.2%, the lowest they’ve been since the waning months of the Covid pandemic. These are the kinds of data points the Fed is looking for, by the way, when it decides on whether to cut interest rates based on disinflationary economic data.Speaking of the Fed, its latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting concludes this afternoon, with a new statement released on interest rate policy. Virtually no one expects to see a move from the 5.25-5.50% Fed funds rate that has been in effect since late July 2023. This will be followed by a press conference and QA with Fed Chair Jerome Powell in the 1pm hour ET. It will be interesting to hear the Fed’s forecast based on this modestly shrinking labor market results from ADP this morning.Meanwhile, Boeing BA outperformed expectations in its Q4 earnings report this morning, to -$0.47 per share from -$0.72 expected (and the -$1.75 per share reported in the year-ago quarter). However, the aerospace major has suspended forward guidance for 2024, based on the fate of its 737 MAX fleet, which saw a fuselage panel blowout on a recent flight. We’re also four years into the tenure of CEO Dave Calhoun (who took over following two 737 MAX crashes in late 2018 and early 2019), where Boeing has reported 10 earnings misses in the past 14 quarters. Shares are up nearly +2% on the Q4 news.Diabetes and weight-loss drug specialist Novo Nordisk NVO, the Denmark-based maker of Ozempic, Rybelsus, Wegovy and many others, also outperformed expectations on both top and bottom lines: earnings of 71 cents per share outpaced the Zacks consensus by 5 cents (and well above the 42 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter), while revenues of $9.51 billion swept past the $9.14 billion analysts were looking for. Ozempic rose +85% in the quarter, while weight-loss treatments Saxenda and Wegovy together grew +114% in the quarter. Shares are up +2.3% on the news in today’s pre-market.

These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently.

      "0.0 0.0\n",
      "Core operating earnings/(loss) is defined as GAAP Earnings/(loss) from operations excluding the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core operating margin is defined as Core operating earnings/(loss) expressed as a percentage of revenue. Core earnings/(loss) per share is defined as GAAP Diluted earnings/(loss) per share excluding the net earnings/(loss) per share impact of the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. Management uses core operating earnings/(loss), core operating margin and core earnings/(loss) per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as they exclude non-service pension and post-retirement costs, which primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to government contracts. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided on page 12 and page 13.\n",

      "Free cash flow is GAAP operating cash flow reduced by capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders, debt repayment, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses free cash flow as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity. See Table 2 on page 2 for reconciliation of free cash flow to GAAP operating cash flow.\n",

      "We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information presented excludes certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into the company's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following definitions are provided:\n",

      "0.0 0.0\n",
      "Core operating earnings/(loss) is defined as GAAP Earnings/(loss) from operations excluding the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core operating margin is defined as Core operating earnings/(loss) expressed as a percentage of revenue. Core earnings/(loss) per share is defined as GAAP Diluted earnings/(loss) per share excluding the net earnings/(loss) per share impact of the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. Management uses core operating earnings/(loss), core operating margin and core earnings/(loss) per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as they exclude non-service pension and post-retirement costs, which primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to government contracts. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided on page 12 and page 13.\n",

Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders, debt repayment, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses free cash flow as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity. See Table 2 on page 2 for reconciliation of free cash flow to GAAP operating cash flow.\n",

      "Boeing, headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, is one of the largest aerospace companies in the world. Its Commercial Airplanes Segment is a leading producer of commercial aircraft and offers a family of commercial jetliners including its 737 MAX. Approximately five years ago, two Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes were involved in fatal crashes caused by malfunctions due to design flaws in the 737 MAX’s flight control software. The first crash occurred in October 2018 and the second crash occurred in March 2019 killing a total of 346 people and leading to 737 MAX planes being grounded from March 2019 to December 2020.\n",

      "The Class Period starts on October 23, 2019, when Defendants boasted that Boeing was making progress towards the safe return to service of the 737 MAX. Throughout the Class Period, Defendants continued to assure investors that Boeing was laser-focused on safety and quality. Defendants also claimed that Boeing did not make trade-offs between safety and profit, and that safety was Boeing’s priority.\n",
      "0.5 0.5\n",
      "Unbeknownst to investors, statements such as those above were false and misleading because Boeing failed to disclose that it had been prioritizing its profits over safety, which led to poor quality control standards in the production of its commercial aircrafts such as the 737 MAX, resulting in a heightened risk of manufacturing flaws which could render the Company’s new airplanes unsafe. This very risk had materialized during the Class Period. These false and misleading statements caused Boeing stock to trade at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period.\n",

      "It took a near disaster to expose this heightened safety risk. The public first learned about it on January 5, 2024 when a panel called a “door plug” flew out of the side of a 737 MAX 9 (a variant of 737 MAX) during Alaska Airlines Flight 1282. This left a gaping hole in the plane’s main cabin, feet from where passengers were sitting. Over the next few weeks, investigations into the incident continued and problems with such door plugs on other 737 MAX planes were discovered including loose bolts holding the door plugs in place, further revealing the Company’s manufacturing and production missteps and leading to the grounding of many 737 MAX 9 planes. In reaction to these and other related disclosures, Boeing’s stock price plummeted from $249.00 on January 5, 2024 to $201.88 on January 25, 2024, a $47.12 per share or 18.9% decline.\n",

As you see, we reported a Q3 profit after tax of €15 million. Traffic and fares were ahead of the prior year, but closing Christmas and New Year loads and yields were softer than previously expected, as we had to lower prices somewhat in response to the very sudden, but surprising but very welcome removal of flights from most of the major OTA pirate websites in early December. Profit after tax, however, for the 9 months ended 31 December was up 39% at €2.19 billion.\n",
      "0.35229978354978353 0.5288961038961039\n",
      "Prior year, it was €1.58 billion. Just to touch on some brief Q3 highlights. The traffic grew 7% to 41 million. Revenue per passenger was up 9%. Average fares were up 13%, mainly due to a very strong Christmas and the October bank holiday weekend and ancillary revenues up 2%. MSCI raised their ESG rating on Ryanair from a BBB to an A in December. Our fuel bill rose €320 million in the quarter, up 35% to €1.2 billion. At the quarter end, we had 136 B737 Gamechangers in the total fleet that was significantly behind the original deliveries due to Boeing delays. More importantly, going forward, our fuel hedging, we’ve extended fuel hedging. We have 65% of our FY ‘25 fuel now hedged at $79 per barrel. This year, we are hedged at $89 per barrel.\n",
      "0.13652777777777778 0.5905555555555556\n",
      "So we have already banked a saving of €450 million into FY ‘25. And as you will all be aware, we have ended the first interim dividend of €0.175 per share is payable on the February 28. I think just to touch on growth in fleet. At the end of Q3, we’ve taken delivery of 136 737 Gamechangers. We now expect to have up to 174 of these aircraft in our fleet by the end of June in time for peak summer 2024, that’s up 50 aircraft from summer 2023. That would still be 7 aircraft short of our contracted deliveries due to Boeing delivery delays. However, those new aircraft means we have a bumper summer 2024 schedule now on sale. It includes 169 new routes, our first 11 domestic routes in Morocco and our first summer with 23 routes in Albania, are in to and from Tirana, the capital city of Albania.\n",
      "0.1275252525252525 0.3260101010101011\n",
      "While travel demand remains high, we expect summer ‘24 EU short-haul capacity to be behind where it was in summer ‘23 as a considerable number of our competitors ground the A320 aircraft in Europe due to the Pratt  Whitney engine issues and Boeing delivery delays constrain our growth from 57 to 50 aircraft. We are continuing to work closely with Boeing to minimize delivery delays and we have invested in additional engineering over – Ryanair engineering oversight to improve the quality control in both Wichita and Seattle. The recent MAX 9 grounding was a disappointing setback, but we welcome the ungrounding of the MAX 9 last week. Ryanair do not operate any MAX 9 variant. There are no MAX 9 aircraft in Europe, and therefore, it is largely a U.S. issue.\n",
      "0.01658730158730159 0.49002645502645503\n",
      "However, Neil visited in Seattle in January, met with Boeing’s senior management and we urge them and they have agreed to increase their quality assurance resources on the ground in Wichita and Seattle. We are putting more engineers into Wichita and Seattle to run extra checks on our deliveries, but also on our recent 737 deliveries, we’ve noted improvements in the quality with fewer delivery defects on the 12 aircraft we got in the fourth quarter before Christmas. However, we do believe Boeing have more work to do to improve quality and reduce delivery delays. But – and I want to stress this, we are fully supportive of the initiatives that David Calhoun and Brian West are taking to improve Boeing’s performance and production. It is critical, we believe, to Boeing’s continued performance that we support Calhoun and West.\n",
      "0.21428571428571427 0.45000000000000007\n",
      "I think they are a good team. I have concerns about the management in Seattle, but I have a lot of confidence in Calhoun and Brian West. I think they are on the right track. The MAX 9 grounding was an unfortunate event, and it does indicate that quality does need to be improved in Boeing, but we are very supportive and a lot of confidence in what Calhoun is doing under his leadership. We welcome – on the OTAs, this is a significant event in December. The timing of the OTA taking, as I said, was a bit unfortunate, because it was the first week in December. With Christmas coming, you can’t just go in and open up and dump seats to counteract that. We think historically, these OTA pirates generally account for between 10% and 15% of our volume.\n",
      "0.19188311688311688 0.6585497835497836\n",
      "So a sudden removal of that meant, we saw a sudden – or a very short-term dip in our bookings. We would normally respond to that by opening up price promotions, but we didn’t want to do that in the run into Christmas. We therefore think we’ll take a hit of 1% or 2% on load factor in December and January. We will take it into hit on yields during December and January, but we think it will be short-lived and we are happy with the forward bookings, particularly out into February and March, although March is slightly – is artificially enhanced by having the first half of Easter in that. Much more important for Ryanair and our passengers is to convert these OTA pirates into what we now would call kind of approved OTA partners. The partnership agreement we signed last week with loveholidays who were our fourth largest OTA and Kiwi.com this morning, who are our largest – where our largest OTA pirates, are critical, we think to protecting customers from OTA overcharges and scams.\n",
      "0.15333333333333335 0.5366666666666667\n",
      "As part of this agreement, we now give these two approved OTA direct feed of inventory from the ryanair.com website and they agree as part of the deal, no overcharging of passengers for either airfares or for any of our ancillaries. The bookings are made directly in the ryanair.com website with the customer’s actual and real e-mail address and real payment details, so that if we need to send a customer an e-mail or some flight information, it goes directly to the customer, it doesn’t get lost in some OTA pirate fake e-mail address. And whenever we have to refund to passengers, we can now make the bookings directly to the passengers. We think this is the way forward and we will continue to campaign to outlaw the illegal screen scraping and the customer overcharging and scamming being undertaken by so many others of these OTA pirates and converted them to the same system or the same mechanism that we now agree with loveholidays and Kiwi.\n",
      "0.025000000000000005 0.3791666666666667\n",
      "Looking forward to the summer 2024, we expect airlines will continue to consolidate. We expect capacity will be constrained by both the consolidation by the lack of aircraft deliveries post-COVID across Europe. And I think the A320 fleet grounding this summer, we expect about 10% of Europe’s A320 fleet to be grounded for the – while they address the Pratt  Whitney engine issues and that this will mean tight supply for summer 2024. And while we still have 50 additional aircraft into that marketplace, we don’t have the original 57 we had hoped for. So we think there is going to be a reasonably strong summer pricing. Already today, our bookings are running about 5% ahead of where they were, forward bookings into the summer about 5% ahead of where they were this time last year.\n",
      "0.06345238095238094 0.5046428571428572\n",
      "Pricing is up by a low single-digit percentage. Again, some of that, I think, is a factor of the fact that the first half of Easter has moved into March. So, Q4 is strong. But therefore, there is less of an impact of Easter pricing in April. But much work remains to be done, but we are very pleased with where we are for summer 2024. In terms of outlook, we are targeting 183.5 million passengers in the current year. That will still be a monumental achievement. The original budget was 185 million. But if you take the ATC – it’s been over 60 days of ATC strikes, that’s cost us over 1 million seats. The Tel Aviv cancellations, which have been running since the end of – since the end of November, that’s cost us about another 600,000 seats and the Boeing delivery delays have meant we’ve had to truncate both the summer 2024 – summer ‘23 schedule and our winter ‘24 schedule.\n",
      "0.17500000000000002 0.4388888888888889\n",
      "So, it will still be a very strong performance. However, as a result of these lower load factors, particularly in Q3 and the kicking in of some higher productivity pay agreements with pilot unions across Belgium, Italy and in the UK, these are productivity enhancements that we intend to rollout to most of the other by agreement with the other pilot unions and groups between now and summer 2024, which will significantly improve our operational resilience and reduce pilot attrition. We now expect full year ‘24 ex-fuel unit cost to rise by about €2.50. That would still leave a dramatically wider cost gap between Ryanair and our main European competitor airlines, two of whom reported last week. Q4, which is traditionally the weakest quarter will also be impacted by the partial unwind of free ETS carbon credits in the January 1, but we will benefit from a strong first half of Easter traffic falling into late March, although this is unlikely to offset the weaker than previously expected load factors and yields in late Q3 and early Q4.\n",
      "0.08356060606060606 0.47022727272727277\n",
      "We are therefore this morning narrowing our full year FY ‘24 profit after tax guidance to a range of between €1.85 billion to €1.95 billion. It was previously €1.85 billion to €2.05 billion. So we think the number will come in just under €2 billion for the full year. However, this guidance and the full year results still remains heavily dependent upon avoiding unforeseen adverse events in Q4, such as the Ukraine war, the Israel Hamas conflict and any further Boeing delivery delays, which might damage us in the run into Easter. We have also given you a full update or we have attached to the release, a full update on the OTA pirate situation. I think this has been one of the most dramatic victories for Ryanair in recent years. And I would always be happy to take a short-term pain if it’s getting rid of OTA pirate scamming and overcharging our customers and moving those into a more cooperative working with us.\n",
      "0.19642857142857142 0.519047619047619\n",
      "It also, I think the new agreement this morning with loveholidays and with Kiwi exposes the falsehood of some of these OTA claims that Ryanair is just trying to eliminate OTA. We are not – we have, for many years, worked with OTAs like Google Flight who just – who are an honest price transparency website, but who send passengers directly to Ryanair to make the booking. The reason we have a problem with the OTA pirates is the illegal screen scraping of our digital – of our data and then using that to scam customers for excessive airfares, inflated ancillary services, and in some cases, charging them for non-existing services such as refund insurance and/or change fees, while it’s a non-changeable ticket. But I think it’s been a very good month or 2 months work and is long-term very much in Ryanair’s interest and in the interest of our consumers that they can get access to our low fares, our low cost ancillary services without being scammed by some intermediaries.\n",

We continue to be the most highly rated airline in the world with a BBB+ rating from Fitch and SP. And a big advantage that we have in these markets is unencumbered Boeing 747 fleet, 546 unencumbered aircraft. And so we are generating net interest income in the business at a time when our competitors are refinancing or taking on expensive leases. So that’s a big competitive advantage that we have. You touched on the hedging, but I think we shouldn’t underestimate the benefit of the certainty that we have now in our hedging out to the end of March 2025, €450 million worth of savings being locked in and one are very volatile markets at this point in time.\n",

      "After the devastating 2019 MAX crashes that resulted in 376 deaths, the Boeing board established heightened safety processes, including a special five-person Aerospace Safety Subcommittee of the Board, as well as a Chief Aerospace Safety Officer within the company. Although four of the five members of the Safety Subcommittee are new board members with less than two years of experience (which is hardly surprising considering that 80% of Boeing’s board has turned over since 2019), their credentials are undoubtedly sterling, drawing across extensive aerospace sector experience. These include Subcommittee Chair and former CEO of GE Aviation David Joyce, former head of the U.S. Navy Adm. John Richardson, former CEO of Continental Airlines Lawrence Kellner, former Inspector General of the Air Force Gen. Stayce Harris, and Carrier Global CEO David Gitlin.\n",

      "Yet the continued flare-up of safety issues means that something is evidently getting lost in translation between the board and the manufacturing and assembly lines–and the challenge runs much deeper than any single incident. How deeply the new quality control processes have permeated into Boeing’s production plants is an open question. One wonders whether safety-focused voices are sufficiently empowered internally, as one whistleblower report claimed that Boeing’s own quality control systems were routinely ignored with under-pressure line inspectors sometimes providing false or erroneous information, which would be consistent with long-running complaints of underinvestment and inadequate self-policing.\n",

      "Calhoun’s appointment of an external safety expert to review Boeing’s safety processes is a step in the right direction–but the FAA appears to be pushing for more wholesale and permanent changes, including embedding FAA or third-party monitors directly across Boeing’s supply chain, unsatisfied with mere auditing.\n",

      "By all appearances, Boeing has lost functional oversight and control over its suppliers, an issue that has been exacerbated by a lack of supply chain diversification and accountability. This is embodied by Boeing’s dysfunctional relationship with Spirit AeroSystems, which manufactures virtually all of Boeing’s fuselages.\n",

      "For years, we have presciently and repeatedly warned about the latent risk posed by Spirit to Boeing’s operations, as the “soft underbelly” in the supply chain, and how former CEO Harry Stonecipher made a mistake by selling Spirit in 2005–but new whistleblower reports suggest that this dysfunctional marriage may be even worse than we appreciated.\n",

      "According to a fresh report in the Seattle Times this week, citing an anonymous but credible whistleblower, Boeing engineers found no less than 392 instances of Spirit quality control failures over the last year. In one instance, Spirit’s engineers supposedly repaired the issues, only for the Boeing inspector to discover that Spirit merely “painted over” the problematic parts, forcing Boeing to do any further repairs in-house. Additional reports document how Spirit employees were encouraged not to report problems amidst a culture of fear, intimidation, and cost-cutting, with expert veteran engineers replaced by legions of cheaper and undertrained replacements. Boeing has refused to respond to media requests for comment, citing ongoing investigations. Meanwhile, Spirit has issued a statement saying that their primary focus is “the quality and product integrity of the aircraft structures” they deliver, adding that the company was working with Boeing on the matter and following regulators’ protocols.\n",

      "Although the Spirit leadership ranks have almost completely turned over in the last four months amidst apparent pressure, and even if accomplished new CEO Pat Shanahan is committed to fixing Spirit’s process challenges, the last 20 years have shown that Spirit should not be a standalone company, period. No matter how much Boeing’s financial whiz kids resist the prospect of diluting Boeing’s prized free cash flow with Spirit’s low-margin, capital-intensive business, and wobbly balance sheet, one has to wonder whether a sum equivalent to 3% of Boeing’s market capitalization is worth all the operational headaches, especially as Boeing continues to inject hundreds of millions into Spirit to keep it afloat.\n",
      "0.11553030303030304 0.336489898989899\n",
      "The silver lining here for Boeing is that almost all of its suppliers are heavily dependent on Boeing and thus, all are aligned and motivated to urgently fix these underlying, long-deferred structural challenges together.

      "When Boeing faced similarly protracted regulatory reviews before, some of Calhoun's predecessors of were ill-advised to hide behind exceedingly vague, impersonal legalese in deference to regulators and investigators–which did not end well. This time around, Boeing’s challenge is even more acute since there will almost certainly need to be difficult but necessary tradeoffs in the months ahead. For example, even though Boeing has said repeatedly that building and delivering more MAXs is their top priority this year, many analysts consider it likely that Boeing will need to lower the lofty production and financial targets laid out merely months ago, and will likely need to withhold guidance during its highly anticipated earnings call on Wednesday. Some have also floated the prospect of internal reorganizations as accountability beckons.\n",

      "Now more than ever, Justice Louis Brandeis’ quip that “sunlight is the best disinfectant” rings true. Public safety and fortifying public trust must outweigh all short-term commercial impacts, no matter what investors or lawyers say. Needless market panic, employee confusion, and sensationalized speculation can be avoided if tough but necessary moves are packaged and perceived as a part of a broader strategic plan to restore Boeing’s credibility, rather than being seen as reactionary impulsiveness or palace intrigue.\n",
