Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.', 'My name is Seb, and Ill be the coordinator today.', '(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to Ryan Avey, Senior Director of Investor Relations and FPA.', 'Thank you, Seb, and good morning, everyone.', 'With me today are Spirits President and Chief Executive Officer, Pat Shanahan and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Suchinski.Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections or goals we may include in our discussion today are likely to involve risks, including those detailed in our earnings release, in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement at the end of this web presentation.In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures we use when discussing our results.With that, Id like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Pat Shanahan.', 'Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everyone.', 'Welcome to Spirits Third Quarter Earnings Call.', 'It is a privilege to be here with you today representing Spirit AeroSystems and our global team.', 'I want to thank the Board for entrusting me with this responsibility while we search for a permanent CEO.', 'On behalf of the entire Board, we thank Tom Gentile for 7 years of dedication and service with Spirit.Im very familiar with Spirit and its operations from my time at Boeing and as a Board member for the past 2 years.', 'My trips to Wichita go back to the 90s, where we tackled new programs and production rate increases together.Now I am the supplier, not the customer, but the dynamics are the same.', 'Over the past several years, Spirit has expanded its portfolio of commercial and defense businesses.', 'However, the core of the business, designing and building large-scale aerostructures, has not changed.Ive been in the role for about 30 days now.', 'To borrow a military acronym, my approach since the first day has been TACOMO: Take charge and move out, meaning Im with the Spirit team at all levels, deep into program and production rate plans and engaging with all our major customers.My initial impressions are that we have a strong team and tremendous capabilities, but we need better precision in our plans, better performance and the right schedule.We are manufacturing a product weve produced in large quantity at high rates before, as opposed to being in the throes of complex commercial development while concurrently ramping up production.My focus is simultaneously stabilizing operations, delivering on our customer commitments and strengthening Spirit financially.', 'I want 100% alignment with our commercial and defense customers.', 'Im driving performance every day.', 'And most importantly, building cohesive teams that view working together as the most effective way to perform and win.The recent agreement with Boeing was an important step in the right direction.', 'The strengthened partnership will support our shared goals of both companies to execute the increasing production rates.', 'Also, Im devoting increased attention to our other major OEM commercial partnership.', 'Let me touch briefly on our strategy.', 'I do not intend to wait for my replacement before moving forward.Regarding diversification, I will narrow the aperture.', 'I dont have an appetite for next square adjacencies.', 'We at Spirit will build on our core defense and aftermarket success.My principal goal is to be cash flow positive as soon as possible.', 'Executing on programs, increasing deliveries is the most crucial lever to achieve that goal.', 'However, we have other cash levers to pull to accelerate many of the activities previously developed, along with new ones we are uncovering every day.Shifting the discussion to market demand.', 'Its incredible what a difference a couple of years make.', 'We are witnessing unprecedented demand.', 'Im encouraged by the unbelievable organic growth in our core segment with a $42 billion backlog.', 'The demand comes with challenges that we must mitigate as part of a new world that is less stable.I recognize we have disappointed our stakeholders.', 'We want to restore confidence in the company.', 'Im passionate about this industry, our customers and Spirit.', 'Im in Kansas most days because this is where most of the action is.', 'The people here and, quite frankly, at all our operations have been warm and welcoming.', 'Id like to provide you guidance for 2024, but Im not prepared to at this time.', 'My plan is to give guidance on our next earnings call, consistent with previous practices.Ill now turn the call over to Mark to review with you our third quarter financial results.', 'Thank you, Pat, and good morning, everyone.', 'As many of you know, I have known Pat as a member of our Board for a while now, and I look forward to working closely with him as we navigate the path forward.', 'I can tell you that we are aligned on our priorities and the trajectory of Spirit.Now turning to recent events.', 'We are pleased to have reached a memorandum of agreement with Boeing in October, which we expect will result in improved cash flow over the next several years.', 'I want to highlight the financial impacts of the agreement, which will be reflected in our financial results beginning in the fourth quarter.First, the MOA established an immediate higher price on the 787 program, with reductions to pricing on the 737 program beginning in 2026.', 'We expect to record a reversal of a forward loss and material right obligations of $350 million to $370 million as a result of the 787 price increase.With this, a majority of the existing 787 forward loss liability will be reversed, and we anticipate positive margins on the program beginning in the first half of 2025 as production rates increase.Next, the MOA provided for a broad release of existing claims and liabilities, which will include the reversal of $23 million of anticipated claims previously recorded related to the 737 vertical fan attach fitting issue.In addition, we will receive funding for certain tooling and capital through 2025 on the 737 and 787 programs.', 'We will repay the majority of the capital funded related to the 787 program beginning in 2025.', 'In October, we received an advance on the total expected CapEx funding of $100 million.', 'Between now and 2025, there will be some timing differences between the receipt of funds and the CapEx spending, which will be reflected on the statement of cash flows.And finally, the repayment dates were extended on the previously disclosed $100 million -- $180 million advance of customer financing received in the second quarter of this year.', 'We will now make repayments of $90 million in December of 2025 and equal repayments of $45 million in December of 2026 and 2027.The MOA strengthens the relationships with our largest customer and further aligns the parties for future success.', 'Broadly speaking, the agreement provides increased cash over the next several years, which will help support production rate ramps across the different Boeing programs.', 'Now let me take you through the details of our third quarter financial results, which I remind you does not reflect any impacts of the recent Boeing MOA.', 'So now lets start on Slide 2.', 'Revenue for the quarter was $1.4 billion, up 13% from the third quarter of 2022.', 'Year-over-year improvement was primarily due to higher production on almost all of our commercial programs as well as increased Defense and Space and Aftermarket revenues.Overall deliveries for the quarter increased 5% year-over-year.', 'The third quarter 2023 revenue was impacted by disruption from the IAM work stoppage in early July and the 737 aft pressure bulkhead issue and continued supply chain and labor challenges, which resulted in less near-term deliveries, specifically on the 737 program.', 'We now expect full year deliveries on the 737 program of approximately 345 to 360 units.Now turning our attention to EPS.', 'We reported earnings per share of negative $1.94 compared to negative $1.22 in the third quarter of 2022.', 'Excluding certain items, adjusted EPS was negative $1.42 compared to negative $0.15 in the prior year.', 'Operating margin was negative 9% compared to breakeven in the same period of 2022, driven by higher changes in estimates and excess capacity costs recognized during the current period.Third quarter forward losses totaled $101 million and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were $64 million.', 'This compared to $49 million of forward losses and $5 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments in the third quarter of 2022.The current quarter forward losses relate primarily to the 787 and A350 programs and were driven by higher estimates of supply chain labor and other related costs.', 'The unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments relate primarily to the 737 and A320 programs, reflecting higher factory costs and rework costs related to the quality issue on the 737 aft pressure bulkhead.Additionally, excess capacity cost during the third quarter of 2023 were $56 million up from $31 million in the same period of 2022.', 'Other income in the third quarter of this year was $7 million, compared to other expense of $42 million in the prior year.', 'The variance was primarily due to noncash pretax charges of $73 million recorded in the third quarter of 2022, driven by the termination of our pension value Plan A as well as lower pension income during the current period.Lets now turn to free cash flow.', 'Free cash flow usage for the quarter was $136 million.', 'Cash usage increased compared to the same period of 2022, largely driven by the negative impacts of working capital and costs associated with factory disruption.Working capital was impacted by the disruption and work stoppage associated with the IAM strike at the beginning of the third quarter, rework and disruption costs related to the 737 aft pressure bulkhead issue as well as ramping to higher production rates on the 737 program.Third quarter 2023 cash from operations also included $50 million customer advance that was previously disclosed and the payment of the ratification bonus related to the IAM contract of $23 million.', 'We have updated our full year free cash flow to reflect the lower 737 deliveries expected for the year and the impacts of the Boeing MOA, and now expect our full year free cash flow to be in the range of negative $275 million to negative $325 million.With that, lets now turn to cash and debt balances on Slide 3.', 'We ended the quarter with $374 million of cash and $3.9 million of debt.', 'Addressing the $1.2 billion of 2025 debt maturities is a near-term priority, and we continue to evaluate all refinancing options to address debt as well as our overall liquidity.Next, lets discuss our segment performance, starting with the Commercial segment on Slide 4.', 'In the third quarter of 2023, commercial revenue increased 10% over the same period of 2022 due to higher production volumes on almost all of our programs.', 'Quarterly operating margin decreased to negative 7% compared to positive 4% in the prior year, driven by higher unfavorable changes in estimates and excess capacity costs recorded in the current period.The changes in estimates during the third quarter, which I previously discussed, included forward losses of $87 million and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $59 million.', 'In comparison, during the third quarter of 2022, the segment recorded charges of $47 million of forward losses and $7 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments.Next, lets turn to the Defense and Space segment on Slide 5.', 'Defense and Space revenue grew to $206 million or 27% higher than the third quarter of last year due to higher development program activity and increased KC-46 tanker production.Operating margin for the quarter decreased to 5% compared to 11% in 2022, primarily due to higher changes in estimates recorded in the current period.', 'The segment recorded forward loss of $15 million and unfavorable cumulative cash adjustments of $5 million compared to forward losses of $2 million and favorable catch-up adjustments of $2 million in the third quarter of 2022.', 'The forward losses were primarily driven by higher production cost estimates on the Sikorsky CH-53K program and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments that were primarily driven by the P-8 program.For our Aftermarket segment results, lets turn to Slide 6.', 'Aftermarket revenues were $97 million, up 21% compared to the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher spare parts sales.', 'Aftermarket continues to grow along with the global air traffic recovery and is on track to meet the plan for the year.', 'Operating margin for the quarter was 19% compared to 24% during the same period of 2022, driven by sales and model mix.With that, well be happy to take your questions.', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.', 'Good morning, everyone, and welcome, Pat.', 'A bunch of questions here.', 'A bunch of questions, but maybe Ill just jump up.', 'I wanted to ask you specifically, Pat, about 2 things that you said in your opening remarks.One is you talked about other cash levers to pull to accelerate.', 'I wonder if you could expand upon that.', 'And you also talked about having the right schedule.', 'And I wonder when we think about 737 production from here, what does the right schedule mean?', 'And whats really -- what are the 2 or 3 things that you think are most important to getting to adequate 737 profitability and not having more of these negative cume adjustments?', 'Lets maybe take the first one.', 'The biggest, as I mentioned, the biggest lever to get to positive free cash flow is program performance.', 'But thats not a pass for the rest of the team to go after indirect costs.', 'And those range from organization structure to enforcement of contracts with our suppliers to a number of the other traditional things you might address in terms of looking at inefficiencies or belt tightening.In addition to that, they are just things we have to stop doing.', 'So in parallel to the other improvement activity, weve really accelerated our focus on every dollar matters, and lets bring it to the bottom line more quickly.Your other question, I think, is really the most important issue that were dealing with right now, and that is the right schedule.', 'And what Ive learned over my almost 40 years in this business, if you get the right schedule, everything else works.The schedule is a barometer for performance.', 'And if youre on schedule, youre going to realize the appropriate costs.', 'And if you get the right costs, youll get the right financial results.When I look at the schedule and hopefully, with the guidance we provided in terms of end of quarter deliveries, we did the math.', 'And the math is, lets adjust for holidays and nonworking days, our effective rate, when you look at deliveries is were at about 37 to 42 a month in the fourth quarter, delivering to Boeing.We have a path to the 50s in 25.', 'And the reason I say we have a path to the 50s is weve been there before.', 'So its not something new.', 'Its a question of how do we stabilize in our internal operations so that without the effort were using today, we can cost effectively with high-quality produce the fuselages that Boeing so desperately needs.The path is through rate increases.', 'The 2 biggest levers for us are the supply chain and our own internal productivity.', 'When you just look at producing 737 fuselages at 42 a month, its roughly 25,000 parts that go into one.', 'And so at 42, thats 1 million parts we need per month.', 'And when you look at the amount of fasteners that we put in, its something on the order of 10 million a month.And so for us to produce, its really about being synchronized and stable.', 'And theres just a lot of detail that goes into achieving that.', 'I believe that well be able to stabilize here and meet Boeings demands in 2024.', 'Id like to walk you through the detailed schedule that were working on.I would just tell you this, is that were not doing things parametrically.', 'Were down to looking at things by the day, by the train pull, by the supplier.', 'Ive been here only a short period of time, but the readiness that we didnt have in the past is not the readiness you will see in 2024.', 'Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.', 'Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu Good morning, guys.', 'And happy Wednesday to you, too, Pat.', 'So I was wondering if you guys could talk about the free cash flow revision, $275 million to $325 million of usage.', 'How are you thinking about the change there from the prior guide?', 'How much of it is tied to the 737?', 'And just as we think about the step-up in Q4, what really changes in first 30 days or so on the job, what have you seen that could be an immediate improvement?', 'Well, Sheila, let me just take the walk on the headwinds and the tailwinds.', 'And then I think Pat can provide some additional color.', 'The biggest impact to free cash flow from a headwind standpoint is fewer 737 deliveries.', 'And I think the challenge that we have here is when we were staffed to 42 airplanes per month, weve been bringing in parts to help support 42 airplanes per month.And when we drop our deliveries from the previous forecast of 370 to 390 to 345 to 360, a lot of that cost is embedded into our system.', 'And so by not delivering the aircraft, were not collecting the cash on the delivery.So I think the impact is a little bit bigger than youve put in your note as it relates to missing the deliveries.', 'The additional forward losses and the negative cume catch-up adjustments that we took is going to add some additional pressure to cash in the fourth quarter.', 'And then were seeing lower A220 deliveries in the fourth quarter, and thats primarily driven by a customer change in their schedule.On the flip side, positiveness from the Boeing MOA, the 787 price increase and the CapEx funding.', 'So I think if you factor all those things in, the biggest impact, I would say, is the lower 737 deliveries and us being staffed and having the working capital in place, and were just not going to release that inventory and collect the cash.', 'Our next question comes from Myles Walton at Wolfe Research.', 'Myles Alexander Walton One quick clarification and then one question for you, Pat.', 'So on the clarification, are you currently shipping to Boeing, conforming fuselages at this point?', 'I realized that you were able to recognize revenue and earnings on sort of nonconforming and then fix after the fact.', 'But if you can update us if youre now conforming.And then, Pat, you made comments about diversification in your opening remarks.', 'And just curious, I know youve been on the Board for a few years, and youve only been on the job for a very short period of time, but is diversification necessary to make Spirit a great company?', 'It had 80% concentration of rev to Boeing just a few years ago.', 'And obviously, the stock did quite nicely, and the revenue and earnings were actually pretty good.', 'So is diversification required?', 'Maybe Ill just take the diversification one first.', 'To the degree that Spirit has approached that in the past, I would say, no.', 'Diversification doesnt make sense at this time.', 'And when you look at the demand for commercial airplanes, having 2 of the biggest customers in the world and not being able to satisfy the demand, it should command our full attention.On maybe the kind of the next level down, weve built a great defense business here, and its a more dangerous world, and I think what you would take away from some of that is we have tremendous engineering capability.And when you think about the future of large-scale aerostructures, its advanced materials.', 'So to that extent, the diversification and probably developing broader capability in advanced materials makes a lot of sense.', 'Aftermarket is -- just isnt of the volume that we see in the other businesses.And to your earlier question, I believe theyre conforming, well make sure to get back to you on our full answer there.', 'The product that were shipping to Boeing at this point in time is being reworked and is conforming.', 'Weve put the fixes in place.', 'So were in good shape there.', 'Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle from Deutsche Bank.', 'Pat, my understanding is that supplier price negotiations with Airbus these days often involve around moving money from one year to another, but that they often fail to address the underlying long-term unit economics for suppliers.', 'But it seems like you need a real structural fix here rather than a band-aid.', 'So Im curious if you think its possible that you get a structural remedy from Airbus.', 'And if not, maybe you can describe what your alternatives might be.', 'Well, I wont describe what the alternatives are because I think we can get a remedy.', 'And I am spending more and more time with my Airbus counterparts.', 'And this is an item of utmost urgency for me personally, and I will be, if not leading, very deep into these conversations and discussions.', 'If you would indulge me for a minute, just kind of talking about composites and advanced materials, just as I mentioned before, really is the future.', 'And when we think about the situation, we have a near-term financial problem.', 'And when I look at the A220 or the C Series, it was produced about the same time as the 787 and the A350.From a technical standpoint, those products are performing extremely well.', 'The maturity of the production system when those designs were certified were really immature, and there are inherent cost limitations.', 'And the performance that we should be realizing out of the manufacturing system just isnt there, but I think its inherently not there.And between us and Airbus, we have to come to some resolution to address that discontinuity.', 'I think well be able to get to the place that makes sense for both parties.', 'But it is a near-term action that Im committed to undertaking, and my counterparts at Airbus feel the same sense of urgency.', 'Our next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein.', 'Douglas Stuart Harned Good morning.', 'When you look at -- Spirit has been dealing with new quality escapes over the last year that have resulted from manufacturing problems that happened well before this year, such as the tail fittings, the aft bulkhead issue, 787 nonconformities.', 'How do you make sure that there are not more issues like these still to come out?', 'And how are you thinking about changing the way you approach quality from an operational standpoint so you can prevent this in the future?', 'Well, Doug, thats probably reading my mind in terms of whats really going to change the reputation and give customers greater confidence is that we really deliver pristine quality products to our customers.', 'Maybe just let me frame it from this standpoint.', 'The tone from the top internally is that my priority is the safety of our teammates, the quality of the product that we build and productivity.', 'Externally, the focus is quality to our customer and on-time, reliable delivery.The mindset I have is that we can be 0 defects.', 'I mean, we can eliminate all defects.', 'We have a very robust quality management system.', 'But every day, we have to put time and attention to that.', 'And it isnt as though theres a silver bullet out there or a different procedure that we can implement.', 'Its the whole organization being first and foremost, focused on how we build the product.', 'And I think youll see that over time because thats where my time will be in, is where you put your time.', 'It gets peoples attention, and leadership has a long shadow.', 'And I think youll see us improve quite a bit in this area.', 'Our next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays.', 'Mark, I think before you guys had talked about getting to free cash flow positive in 2024.', 'Is there anything on the other side of the Boeing MOA as to why that still wouldnt be the case?', 'Thats my first question.And second question, just an update.', 'You mentioned the urgency around the refinancing.', 'What are you looking at in terms of timing to come to market?', 'I think previously, you talked about maybe doing it in 2 phases.', 'Well, good morning David, good to hear from you.', 'As it relates to 2024, I think Pat said, hes 30 days into his role here.', 'Hes making his way through.', 'Were looking at the business holistically and really focused on completing the year, getting the business stabilized and then providing you guys a good, robust update in February.But Ill just kind of reiterate what we said previously.', 'We expect 2024 to be a positive cash flow year.', 'The Boeing MOA is definitely a benefit to 2024 and beyond.', 'And so Ill leave it at that at this point in time.', 'And in February, well come back and give you more specifics around our plans.As it relates to the refinancing, its obviously a big priority for me.', 'The refinancing is a little more than a year out.', 'The goal here is to assess all of our options that we have at this point in time.Weve got some good plans in place were thinking through.', 'Weve been successful as weve gone to the markets in the past.', 'And I think thats -- as Pat talked about, his big goal of working with Airbus, one of my big goals is getting through the refinancing, getting us behind us so we can focus on the business in 2024.And so theres a sense of urgency there.', 'Its a near-term priority.', 'And were going to be working through that, as I had previously stated, to make sure that we get the refinancing done before the debt becomes short term.', 'Our next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.', 'Its been a while, but good to see you back in there.', 'Good morning, George.', 'And Mark, if I look at this quarters free cash flow, I take out the $100 million that youre getting from Boeing.', 'And I dont -- Im not sure whether you got another advance for Airbus.', 'But if you did, I mean, youre still -- next years free cash ought to be a lot better than just looking at this years fourth -- this years implied fourth quarter, which was like $140 million, take out the $100 million from Boeing, so at $40 million.And I dont think there was an Airbus payment there, you can correct me.', 'But why wouldnt next year at least be as good as the annualized rate for this years fourth quarter?', 'Good question, George.', 'I think as I addressed with David, as it relates to free cash flow, again, well stick with the fact that its going to be positive next year.', 'Well provide you more specifics around that when we come back and chat with you in the first week of February when we disclose our results.We dont want to get ahead of things.', 'Pats got a lot of work to do here, and were all here supporting him.', 'Well pull together a good plan, and well provide you guys an update in February.', 'Then one quick one for you, Mark.', 'The higher than expected excess costs, can you give some color with that and kind of what the thinking might be when we get to the fourth quarter?', 'I would just say this, the third quarter was highly disrupted.', 'When you think about our production, the number of units, our position in the factory starting the quarter, not gearing back the production line back up until around, call it, July 10 because of the IAM work stoppage and then the -- or aft bulkhead issue.So I would say, for the most part, its the IAM strike, it was a quality issue and then just some of our own performance in the factory that ultimately added to the excess costs.', 'And so what I would say is its a little bit of an anomaly because of that.', 'And as we move into 2024, I would expect us to continue to see that those excess costs go down as we go up in rate and absorb more of the fixed cost overhead here.', 'So again, I think well continue to see things improve in the fourth quarter and then get better in 24 as compared to 23.', 'Our next question is from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.', 'Good morning, everybody.', 'Pat, is it at least in the scenario analysis that you stay in the CEO seat long term rather than it being an interim solution?', 'Well, Ill tell you, Noah.', 'My commitment to Adrian, my wife and the Board was that I would do this for a year, stand up the operations so that we could put a strong replacement in place, and that remains the commitment, and no change at this time.', 'And then just as a follow-up on the aft pressure bulkhead challenge on the MAX.', 'I heard you that youre now shipping conforming, clean, new off the line.', 'I guess, what about the inventory rework?', 'And just overall, whats the time frame in which that is behind you completely?', 'I dont have a time frame specifically right now in the work that weve been doing.', 'If we had this call another week, I could probably give you a precise answer.', 'The analysis continues to improve.', 'And so I cant really tell you what the final work scope is there, but its trending towards sooner rather than later.', 'Our next question comes from Robert Stallard from Vertical Research.', 'Pat, this is one for you, actually.', 'On the Airbus negotiations, I was wondering if you could give us some idea of how this differs versus the discussions youve been having with Boeing?', 'And in conjunction with Airbus, the A220 program didnt take a charge this quarter.', 'So I was wondering if you could give us an update on how thats going.', 'Maybe Mark can talk about the charge, and I can talk about the negotiations.', 'Do you want to take that first?', 'No forward loss charge in the A220 program.', 'It was a pretty good quarter.', 'I think the team is doing well.', 'Were meeting our delivery commitments to our customer.', 'And so a pretty quiet quarter on the A220 side.', 'Yes, maybe just a comment on the differences or similarities between the Boeing and the Airbus negotiations.', 'Id say theyre very similar.', 'I mean, the nature -- this is really kind of concentrated on the A220.', 'I mean, at the end of the day, its really about the A220.', 'And like my earlier comment about the maturity of the production system and expectations of performance were not aligned.', 'And until we can get that alignment, it makes producing at the higher rates more difficult.And I think that we will come to a reasonable outcome because its important for -- its important for Airbus.', 'Its important for Spirit.', 'Its important for the airplane.', 'There is strong demand for that airplane.', 'And were committed to Airbus, and I think theyre committed to us, and its just something here in the short term.', 'But Im encouraged, based on the Boeing agreement, that well get there with Airbus.', 'And just a quick follow-up, Pat.', 'Hard to put a time frame on this.', 'Do you think youll get this done before February?', 'Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn from Melius Research.', '[Scott Mikus] on for Rob Spingarn.', 'Pat, I did want to ask you, if you pursue a financial remedy on the A220 or A350, is there any concern that Spirit could potentially see a reduced role later on A220 or A320neo if Airbus rewings those programs?', 'I mean, I spend half my time on that question and half my time on the negotiating.', 'Not as much of the negotiating strategy with the strategy process.', 'And I think with our advanced engineering capability and the things that we do with resin transfer molding, were a critical part.', 'Its not so much the wing of tomorrow.', 'Its just Airbus long-term composite supply chain, I think were a vital piece of that.', 'The issue we have is just here in the near term, how do we solve this financial disconnect?', 'But I would bet on the team in Belfast to be a critical part of Airbus future.We just have the overhang of some agreements that go back a long time pre-COVID that we have to kind of work our way through.', 'But as the earlier remark I made about this company in advanced materials, the things that were doing are really going to be the basis of the next generation of product out there on the defense world and commercially because we can do it at scale and we get reps every single day.And to go replicate some of these assets in a greenfield at scale is cost-prohibitive.', 'So I think its just you get trapped in these situations of managing quarter-to-quarter or that somebody should get better performance than theyre actually realizing.', 'And I think just like with the Boeing agreement, were going to get to a place that makes sense for both parties.', 'Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen.', 'So the Boeing MOA basically, you basically get some -- have to take a lower price on the 737 as you get out to 26.', 'And you get a much higher price on the 787 near term.', 'But then around the middle of 2008, you have the renegotiation of the price on the 787.', 'And I mean, as I read what Ive read of the MOA, it looks like basically barring any change in the negotiation, that the 787 price at that point goes back to where it currently is or relatively close.Is that your read or so -- how should I be concerned that thats a real liability or as you get out there that the 87 could revert to going back into modest, basically breakeven or a loss?', 'Let me jump in there.', 'I would say that we came to a good conclusion on the appropriate pricing on the 787 program, essentially out through the order book.', 'We have a commitment between the 2 parties to negotiate a fair and reasonable price beyond 1605, one year in advance of that delivery date.', 'And just like we came to an appropriate conclusion, which allows Spirit to make an appropriate margin on that airplane program here shortly.', 'Thats what our expectations will be long term.', 'And if I may, one more on the Airbus talks, clearly, its going to be difficult to do a refi unless that is behind you.', 'Does that -- do you feel that puts increased pressure on you to kind of come to the table more quickly?', 'Or how do you deal with that timing issue of having to get that done before a refi?', 'Cai, I dont think were in a position where were pressured to negotiate.', 'I mean, Mark, you might comment just on the financial situation, but I think we have time to get it right, but theres no point in wasting time.', 'No, I agree with Pat.', 'Id just say this, Cai, I think the Boeing MOA provides a nice boost to liquidity here over the next several years.', 'And I think we have some momentum here on that front.', 'And so again, when it comes to the refinancing, were going to do whats best for us, for our company and for our shareholders.', 'And work through that accordingly.', 'And as Pat said, no pressure on the Airbus side.', 'That will happen in its due course.', 'Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons at UBS.', 'Pat, you suggested youll be delivering, I think, around 37 to 42 a month in the fourth quarter.', 'Just to clarify, is your plan still that youll be cycling and delivering at 42, starting in 2024?', 'Or is there a spread?', 'And then could you update us on the current MAX inventory buffer?', 'And in terms of the buffer, I dont have... Weve got, as you know, a mix of units in there.', 'So we -- Gavin, we have about 80 units in buffer.', 'We like to categorize them in 2 components.', 'Units that are on hold and then units that are available to ship.', 'So theres around 50 units that have -- that are in Boeings -- in the buffer, Boeing owns title to those, and Boeing can pull them whenever theyre ready to pull.So buffers increased a bit.', 'At the end of the second quarter, it was low as we prepared for the work stoppage issue, but weve been able to build up that buffer to a certain degree.', 'And as Pat said, the goal here is as we move forward here to sync up our production schedules.', 'But thats an update on the buffer.', 'Our next question comes from Peter Arment from Baird.', 'The $100 million youre getting for tooling-related equipment for the 737 and 787, can you kind of give us a little more color of what the real benefit is there?', 'I mean, obviously, its nice to see the cash infusion.', 'But as Pat you said, youve been at these higher rates before.', 'So what is actually the benefit that youre seeing here?', 'Number one, with most OEMs, if you have production rate increases or model mix or new derivatives, the OEMs always own the tooling, right?', 'And so thats unchanged from our previous agreements.', 'But in this current environment, when we look at the model mixes -- and we have the Dash-7s, the 8s, the 9s and the 10s, Boeing is selling more 7s, more 10s, and that has an impact on our production system.', 'And so therefore, its going to require us to make some capital investment.', 'And so one of the benefits of the agreement, we appreciate this from Boeing is theyre going to pay for some capital that normally Spirit would have to pay.And normally, what would happen is as we built those units, wed absorb more overhead and that would help profitability.', 'But the big benefit here is its a combination of tooling and capital that Boeing is going to pay for.', 'Theyve given us an advance in the fourth quarter and some funding in 24 and a little bit in 25, and thats going to result in us spending higher CapEx in 24 and 25 to reflect the new models and the adjustments we need to make in the production system.So there is a benefit to Spirit.', 'Its going to be a little lumpy when the receipts come in and when the funds go out.', 'But we think our Boeing customer, theyre making the actual capital investment themselves.', 'And so we appreciate that.', 'So really, thats in a nutshell.', 'Its a nice little benefit, although its cash neutral, it is a benefit to Spirit.', 'Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli from Truist.', 'Michael Frank Ciarmoli Pat or Mark, just on the MOA, can you maybe help us out or give us a little bit more detail?', 'Obviously, you kind of cotriangulate where the 787 deliveries are going to be this year.', 'You got the $60 million revenue increase.', 'I mean, was that all pricing?', 'And should we assume thats kind of maybe rough $2 million per unit pricing?And then you kind of said not going to be margin positive for 25.', 'I guess the reversal of the amortization looks to be an additive, but I think youre still paying back from the existing MOU, the 450,000.', 'Can you just help us bridge some of those moving pieces so we can get a better expectation on 787?', 'Im not going to comment specifically on what the price increase is per unit.', 'But I think the -- what you should take from the agreement is were reversing forward losses where previously in the future, our cost was higher than our price.', 'So when you reduce a forward loss, right, and the cost forecast is unchanged, its a pricing benefit.', 'So those losses or those cash losses that we would book in the future, were reversing those because those no longer exist.And then when we talk about when we get to positive margins on that program, were at 4, 5 a month, moving to 7 a month.', 'So its going to take us a little time to absorb some of that overhead and get the full benefits of the pricing agreement.', 'And so when we look at the early part of 2025, were going to be at a higher rate than we are right now.And based on the price were getting paid per unit and what our cost projections are, we talked about being positive margins, and we expect that to be a benefit on an ongoing basis.So again, I dont want to get into specifics about how much we got paid, but its a big, big deal to Spirit.', 'Were at the point now where we were in a loss position since essentially the inception of the program.And here in short order, our cash and the revenue will be higher than our cost, and it will be a cash positive program for us.', 'And so a good thing for us as that program starts to go up and right here over the next 12 to 18 months.', 'Our last question today comes from Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley.', 'Pat and Mark, the MOA with Boeing clearly signaled to Spirit equity and bondholders your strategic importance to Boeing.', 'I mean that said, operations continue to get worse with the forward losses and the negative cumulative catch-ups, even in defense.', 'So from your conversations with Boeing, to what degree does Boeings financial support extend?', 'And can Boeing step in to explicitly help underwrite the refinancing of the 2025 maturities?', 'Good morning, Kristine.', 'An interesting question.', 'And we do thank our big customer for the agreement that we have in place, and we think its -- they deemed it as a win-win.', 'I wouldnt view it as charity.', 'I think we perform a great service to our customers.', 'I think we do a great job performing on their programs.', 'And so overall, its -- they describe it as a win-win.', 'And we view it as a win-win.As it relates to refinancing strategies, as Ive said before, we have access to the capital markets.', 'We dont need Boeing to underwrite us as we think about our strategies around upcoming maturities.', 'And I would just kind of leave it at that.', 'And if I could do a follow-up.', 'When we factor in the current inflation environment, the higher labor costs, in the pricing step down for the 737 come 2026, what should margins for the program be for the 737 at that point?', 'And how would that compare to where we were around the 2019 levels?', 'Hey Kristine, Id just say this, hey, before we jump to 2026, let us get through 2023 and have a good, robust discussion with you in February about 2024.', 'Well have those discussions in good time.', 'This concludes todays conference call.', 'Thank you all very much for dialing in, and have a wonderful day.']",['Q3 2023 Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc Earnings Call'],['Q3 2023 Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc Earnings Call'],"['Mark J.

expanding backlog, sales and margins as we focus on profitable growth and building on our success in the aftermarket.', 'We are entering the second half of the year from a position of strength and raising our fiscal 2024 sales, earnings and cash guidance.', 'Our year-to-date performance, increasing commercial aircraft build rates and growth in defense spending supports our updated outlook for the year.During the second quarter, we met or exceeded our expectations, delivering strong sales and our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth as well as predictable profitability.', 'Our deleveraging plan is on track, including over $60 million in debt reduction since the start of the fiscal year, which will yield approximately $5 million in annualized interest savings.As I reflect on the quarter, Im pleased with our ability to execute on our short-term performance targets, we remain very excited about the long-term financial and operational opportunities for Triumph.', 'In particular, our performance serves as evidence that we continue to accelerate our future towards the targets we discussed at our September Investor Day.Turning to Slide 3.', 'Ill summarize the highlights for the quarter.', 'Year-over-year organic sales growth was 16% and driven by improving MRO demand, accelerated above Q1s 14% growth and above our original guidance.', 'Aftermarket sales increased year-over-year accounting for a robust 43% of our Q2 sales, roughly doubled since the start of our restructuring.Recall our Interiors business started the year slow, with slower ramps in sales, supply chain delays, inflationary pressures and unfavorable foreign exchange headwinds.', 'The team began executing on our recovery plans and exited September at breakeven on increasing volumes and growing backlog.And last, we grew our total company backlog by 15% above market growth rates as Triumph benefits from strong representation across a broad array of platforms, customers and end markets.', 'We continue to benefit from growing commercial travel demand up 28% through August year-over-year.', 'and increased MRO demand as aircraft returned from peak summer use, commercial transport aircraft new orders more than 2,000 year-to-date and planned OEM rate step-ups.Book-to-bill is 1.37 year-to-date and $1.8 billion of reportable backlog is up 16% year-over-year, even as past due backlog has been driven down by $17 million or about 18% this fiscal year-to-date.', 'In the military market, there is a robust U.S. defense budget in place and expectations for it to remain at similar levels for the next few years.', 'Given the multiple regional conflicts, budgets are likely to grow beyond current forecast.', 'Triumph is currently engaged in an unprecedented number of military OEM opportunities including over 30 classified RFPs year-to-date.', 'We are in discussions on hydraulic systems, fuel pumps, landing gear systems, thermal systems, gear boxes, door actuation and more.', 'all driven by expanding Triumph intellectual property.In Q2, Triumphs commercial OEM shipments were up 70% year-over-year, while commercial aftermarket revenues rose 48% year-over-year.', 'Military OEM sales were consistent with prior year, while military MRO rose 24% year-over-year on the strength of many programs, led by V-22 pylon conversion actuators.As we shared at our recent Investor Day, Triumph enjoys significant content on Boeing 787 aircraft with just over 1 million shipset value, benefiting both the OEM and MRO sales across 6 Triumph factories.', 'This is a great aircraft with more than 1,800 orders since 2013 and a backlog of nearly 800 aircraft, 235 of which were ordered in 2023.', 'So demand is robust, and Boeing is working to increase rate as rapidly as possible.', 'Orders in our portal support the move to rate 5.3 per month in our fiscal year, up nearly 2x from the start of our year and 787 shipments for the second quarter were up 142%.', 'We also anticipate emerging sustainment requirements for the 787 as the oldest aircraft in this fleet are just beginning to exceed 10 years in service.As these aircraft enter their landing gear maintenance cycle, Triumph will begin overhauling increasing numbers of our landing gear actuation components, including extended retract actuation, truck positioning, nose wheel steering and door actuation.', 'New wins for the quarter included CH-47 engine controls, a UH60 gear package and an accessory repair package for Atlas Air as well as personal service units, cruise seats and starters for Delta Airlines.While only 10% of our sales performance at our interiors business remains a focus area, as an unfavorable sales mix driven by OEM delays and supplier shortages along with margin impacts from inflationary pressures on materials and labor and foreign exchange changes, created headwinds to start the fiscal year.', 'Were running additional Triumph operating system lean events to offset these external headwinds, and were starting to see positive developments.', 'These include events to drive down cycle time and improve efficiencies and productivity.As production demand increases, we are working closely with our customers to derisk the supply chain by securing alternate sources where necessary to keep cost competitive and to in-sourcing more work as rates continue to ramp, which will provide added absorption benefits.', 'Interiors is on a path to recover to mid- to high single-digit margins this fiscal year and to enhance the confidence in their long-term earnings targets.Value pricing remains a key strategy to Triumph is deploying towards our margin expansion goals.', 'This includes the implementation of our expanded commercial playbook, expanding our commercial risk reviews and implementing new processes.', 'Given the evolving market environment, this has included exploring shorter duration supplier and customer contracts, incorporating inflation clauses tied to indices or specific material pass-through clauses and focusing on aftermarket premiums and market access.Previously, we highlighted that 80% of our contracts have terms of 6 years or less, providing a near constant flow of opportunities to optimize value based on our technical solutions, capabilities and IP and our recent wins include examples of these efforts.', 'We remain on track with the pricing objectives laid out during the recent Investor Day.', 'Jim will now take us through our second quarter results and updated outlook for fiscal 2024.', 'Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone.', 'Triumphs second quarter results exceeded our expectations with significant revenue growth over the prior year period.', 'On Slide 5 are the consolidated results for the quarter.', 'Revenue was $354 million.', 'With the continuing business, excluding divestitures and exited programs, organic revenue increased 16% over the prior year quarter.', 'Organic revenue growth primarily benefited from increased aftermarket volume and pricing on our largest programs, while demand across most of our end markets improved during the quarter on a year-over-year basis.Prior year revenues included a $16 million nonrecurring benefit from the sale of noncore IP, after which revenue growth would be 23%.', 'Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $37 million, representing 11% margin, a 60 basis point increase over last year.', 'And adjusted EBITDAP for the quarter was $46 million, representing a 13% EBITDAP margin, which is on track to our full year guidance.Sequentially, adjusted operating margin was up 300 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin was up 220 basis points over Q1, driven by higher revenue and a favorable mix with an increase in aftermarket sales from 41% to 43% of total revenue.', 'In the quarter, we incurred $1.9 million of restructuring costs to retire our last structures IT contract as our transition services agreement ended, and a $1.3 million charge associated with potential environmental costs at legacy structure site.Slide 6 shows our military revenue.', 'For the quarter, military revenue was $117 million, representing 33% of total revenue.', 'Military OEM sales were strong and on par with last year as increased sales on CH-53K and B22 offset expected lower sales on E-2D and AH-64 programs.', 'Military aftermarket sales in the quarter were up 24% compared to last year and up 70% sequentially on increased demand for spares and repairs.Slide 7 shows our commercial market revenue.', 'For the quarter, commercial revenue was $227 million, representing 64% of total revenue.', 'Commercial OEM sales were $131 million, and absent the sale of noncore IP were up 17% in the continuing business.', 'This growth was driven by increases in both volume and price in key programs, including Boeing 787 and 737 programs.', 'Commercial aftermarket sales of $96 million grew 49% in the continuing business on strong demand for commercial aftermarket spares and repairs.', 'This is our highest quarterly commercial aftermarket sales since fiscal 2017.', 'Remaining 3% of our revenue is non-aviation, which is profitable and represents about $9 million of sales in the quarter.', 'Thats up 24% over last year.', 'Our continuing sales mix trend towards more aftermarket is having a positive impact on margins and cash flow.As I mentioned, total aftermarket sales represented 43% of our quarterly revenue.', 'This was up from 36% in the prior year quarter.', 'The breakdown of our aftermarket sales and MRO capabilities is on Slide 8.Our free cash flow work is on Slide 9, which shows our Q2 and year-to-date cash use.', 'Our $37 million of cash used this quarter included $74 million in semi-annual interest payments as well as planned investment in our net working capital in support of increasing second half sales volume.', 'This is consistent with our expectations and the quarterly free cash flow guidance we previously gave.', 'We expect to be solidly cash positive in Q3 and in Q4 in support of full year cash flow guidance, which is up to $40 million to $55 million.On Slide 10 is our net debt and liquidity.', 'As of September 30, we had $1.5 billion of net debt and our cash availability was approximately $230 million.', 'During the second quarter, we purchased $19 million of our unsecured 7.75% senior notes due in August of 25, and we purchased an additional $29 million so far in the third quarter.', 'We purchased these notes at a discount to par resulting in gains.', 'When combined with the $14 million in bond redemptions in the first quarter, we reduced annualized interest expense by about $5 million.', 'We also have over $300 million deferred tax assets to continue to create value through reduced cash taxes moving forward.Our fiscal 24 guidance begins on Slide 11.', 'We are increasing our fiscal 24 guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and cash flow and updating our operating income guidance.', 'Based on anticipated aircraft production rates, we expect organic growth of 10% to 13% in fiscal 24, with revenue in the range of $1.43 billion to $1.47 billion.', 'Aftermarket volume is the largest component of the increase, followed by OEM volume, pricing and an increase in non-aviation revenue.', 'The aftermarket is expected to grow at 11% rate for the fiscal year.Commercial OEM revenue growth is driven by production ramps on following 737 and 787 programs and the Airbus A320 family, even while supply chain and geared turbofan repairs are considered.', 'Non-aviation sales are expected to increase, driven by the previously announced work supporting hollister sustainment.', 'We increased our adjusted EBITDAP guidance consistent with the increased sales guidance to a range of $216 million to $231 million.', 'Our adjusted EBITDAP margin guidance continues to indicate up to a 16% consolidated EBITDAP margin in fiscal 24, representing roughly a 200 basis point improvement over last year.We increased our cash flow from operations and free cash flow guidance ranges by $5 million for fiscal 24, including second half working capital improvements.', 'We continue to expect solid cash generation in Q3 and strong cash generation in Q4, consistent with prior year seasonality.', 'This is driven by working capital liquidation on the second half sales surge, reduction in past-due backlog and increased OEM inventory turns.Interest expense is expected to be $151 million, including $145 million of cash interest, and we expect $7 million of cash taxes.', 'This is after the cash interest savings from $49 million of bond purchases completed to date.', 'Organic margin expansion, cash generations and debt reduction are expected to drive our net leverage from 7.6x at the end of last year to between 6.1x and 6.3x at the end of this fiscal year.As we discussed at our Investor Day, we are on a path to reduce leverage into the range of 3.5x no later than the end of fiscal 26 through EBITDAP expansion and free cash flow generation.', 'However, Triumph continues to explore alternatives to accelerate deleveraging through business and product line portfolio actions.In summary, the second quarters results are in line with or ahead of our expectations that support the increased full year guidance.', 'We are reducing debt and interest expense by purchasing bonds in the market, growing EBITDAP and generating free cash flow this year.', 'Were executing our multiyear plan to continue to grow revenue, margins and free cash flow, reduce leverage and increase shareholder value.', 'We remain on track to achieving the targets established at our Investor Day in September.Now Ill turn the call back to Dan.', 'Triumphs performance in the second quarter of fiscal 24 highlights the strength of the new Triumph, the stronger systems and aftermarket driven company with a growing IP portfolio and backlog yielding steadily improving financial results year-over-year.', 'We expect improved financial and operational performance to continue throughout the fiscal year as our expanding mix of aftermarket and IP-driven OEM sales gives us confidence in our updated fiscal 2024 guidance and long-term outlook.Jim and I are happy now to take any questions you have.', '(Operator Instructions).', 'Todays first question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.', 'I wanted to ask, in terms of the improvement in the overall outlook, was there any change to the outlook for the Structures business -- or sorry, the Interiors business now.', 'I guess in other words, should we think that Interiors, maybe there are some more challenges there and that was more than offset by the goodness that you see in FNS?', 'Yes, thats how I see it, Seth.', 'We had printed 13% in the quarter despite being breakeven in Interiors.', 'And let me characterize Interiors revenue profile for the year.', 'They started the first quarter of the year with a monthly sales of $10 million to $11 million in the second quarter, that went to $10 million to $12 million.', 'For Q3, were looking at $11 million to $14 million per month, and then in Q4, $15 million to $19 million.', 'So very strong second half sales.We also jumped on it with a return to green program to drive productivity we saw about 10% improvement in productivity through the months of September and October.', 'And these are really two well-run plants in Mexico.', 'The challenges have been external, both foreign exchange and input costs, and were addressing both.', 'On the input cost, were competing the suppliers that have raised prices so that we have alternatives.And on foreign exchange, Ill let Jim address what were doing there.', 'Just to break down and Terry is a little bit further, its really three businesses within one business.', 'Even though its only 10% of sales, its a small contributor to Triumph overall.', 'The insulation piece, which is the biggest piece is a 20% margin is plus margin business.', 'And cabin production parts that we made that support the cabin and is sort of high single digits, where weve been losing money is in composites, which is mostly ducting, so were taking some actions to automate that plant.We just opened a new clean room there, and were doing additional lean events to drive that.', 'But overall, the plants are quite well run.', 'Its just dealing with these external headwinds.', 'But yes, we have a strong second half that we are counting on to be part of the overall trajectory of the company on both sales, cash and profit.', 'They are external drivers like inflation and FX or challenges and the wax and wane, but the reality is we have to get our costs down, and then we have to exercise a right to the contracts for adjustments where we have them.', 'And then where we dont, we have to go negotiate when new contracts come up, adjusted prices to cover those costs.', 'But the team is very active on remediating the challenges there.', 'But I think youre exactly right, that the system strength, which is so important is more than offsetting the Interior challenges.', 'And then maybe just one follow-up, if thats okay.', 'If we think about the military OEM business, and just maybe -- just on the OEM side, you think maybe theres a little more visibility in terms of the content you have and the expected build rates for the platform.', 'It seems like maybe this year can be up a little from last year, which is $260 million to $270 million of sales in the military OEM side.', 'How does that evolve going forward and what are the drivers?', 'Because I know theres probably some legacy rotorcraft that youre on and -- but also some growth opportunities.', 'So how does that piece of the business evolve?', 'We really do have a strong presence in helicopters, especially out of our West Hartford fuel controls, engine controls business and thermal products, but also gearboxes and heat exchangers.', 'So when you look at the rates, we just got the award for the LRIP 7 and 8 lot for CH-53 from Sikorsky, thats a program thats been building at about 0.8 aircraft per month, and its ramping up to over the next 3 years to double that.', 'So thats a nice tailwind for us.', 'MH60 is also growing in rate modestly.', 'We do a lot of gears for the age AH64 Apache, and that rate goes up about 10%, maybe 15% over the forecast.So while its not a doubling sort of build rate increase, unlike last year where we were marking down OEM rates, were finally swinging into positive.', 'And Im very encouraged about the new starts on military.', 'Were getting pulled into lots of bids, Fara, Flora on the helicopter side, are two examples, but also on the next-gen fighters as well.', 'So we see our competency in helicopter components being strength to the company.', 'I would also point you to Page 14, so we have the backlog there by program, and Ill give you more flavor over whats in the next 2 years and the military programs there from F-35, which is 2% of backlog right now, up to the CH-53 is 8% of backlog.', 'And half of those programs are rising in rate, half of them may be reducing in rate or some stable ones.', 'But its a good balanced portfolio of military OEM work.', 'And our next question today comes from Ellen Page at Jefferies.', 'Just going back to Interiors, you had called out FX as a headwind.', 'And the headwind in Q1 as well, how much of the loss was due to the peso?', 'And how do we think about reaching mid to high single digits in fiscal H2.', 'Just what are the kind of moving pieces there?', 'Rough [less been] about $500,000 per month would be peso at the current rate, as you know, the peso strengthened to some all-time highs against the dollar.', 'But that will change over time, and well have the opportunities to reprice and address cost structure to help mitigate that.', 'So thats the piece thats FX related.', 'But Dan talked about some of the actions were taking, which are going to increase the second half.', 'I think volume is one of the biggest drivers.', 'So really expecting a lot more volume in the second half.', 'The mix changing back towards installation, which is more profitable than the ducting is, and some of the cost mitigation actions were taking as well.', 'Can we just go over the moving pieces to the free cash flow guide.', 'You raised OCF by $5 million, I believe.', 'What were the key drivers there?', 'The key driver is really the sales, which is driving profitability, partially offset by the increased working capital needed to supply the higher sales in the second half of the year.', 'So theres -- its a modest increase, but its an important one, and its consistent with those higher sales.', 'What weve been watching very closely, in fact, at the Board level, is the reduction in past-due backlog and working capital because theres been multiple currents within the working capital flow.', 'Weve been investing in working capital for the rotables, for MRO.', 'Thats helped us drive our strong MRO sales and then also protecting OEM ramps by buying more.', 'But at the same time, we want to increase turns on the MRO or on the OEM side.', 'So what we saw in September, October were improvements in both measures, both the past due burn down and the turn.', 'So thats the leading indicator we need to see that confidence that were going to improve working capital in the second half of the year.', 'And our next question today comes from David Strauss with Barclays.', 'On Interiors, would you expect it to get to EBIT or EBITDA positive in Q3?', 'So were exiting breakeven in September.', 'So yes, we expect to be breakeven to positive in Q3 and strong -- solidly positive in Q4 to get back to the mid- to high single digits for the year.', 'And Jim, on free cash flow, I think if I go back to the bar chart that you had in the Q4 slide deck.', 'It looks like Q2 was a little bit weaker than what you were anticipating there if I just compare it to prior years.', 'If so, what was kind of where was the miss relative to your internal plan on cash flow?', 'And that bar chart implied a pretty big Q3 free cash flow number?', 'I know you said positive, but I just want to see if we could revisit kind of the sequential growth in free cash flow youre expecting Q3 and Q4.', 'David, at the end of the fiscal year, we reported, we put out the chart with the cash flow cadence for the 4 quarters that youre referring to.', 'But actually, after Q1, I updated that, and I said $30 million to $40 million cash used, if you look at the transcript for Q1.', 'And at the Investor Day, I reiterated that.', 'And the real driver for a slightly higher cash use was the higher sales were seeing.', 'There was some impact from supply chain and from demand changes.', 'But it was really the higher sales for the second half.So $30 million to $40 million used -- I guess we came in at $37 million used this past quarter, and we should be positive in that range for Q3 in the $30 million to $40 million cash positive and then the balance to get to our full year guidance would be in Q4.', 'So very strong Q4 as weve had in prior years.', 'But with this higher aftermarket percentage at 43%, with even more seasonality and with the ramping production rates I think were going to have a stronger Q4 than weve ever had before.', 'And taken together, year-over-year, its a swing of about $120 million to $130 million in cash flow for the full year.', 'So we feel very good about the trajectory on cash.', 'And Jim, just the net working capital that youre assuming now for the full year, how much of use are you anticipating?', 'I dont have a working out to that level.', 'Its obviously going to be coming down in the second half of the year.', 'And I have to follow up on that and look forward to giving you more information about that moving forward to the absolute working capital level.', 'I can tell you that we are driving turns down, and we have a concerted effort on inventory management to get the turns down to improve the working capital moving forward.And its the right time to do it with ramping sales because we have lots of inventory and we have lots of opportunities to be more efficient with it.', 'Were trying to find the right home for inventories, working with vendors and customers who may have lower cost of capital than us, for vendor managed inventory, customer-owned inventory.', 'So the direction is positive, and were going to be liquidating working capital in the second half of the year.', 'And our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen.', 'So your aftermarket business was strong in the second quarter and a very good sequential gain.', 'Based on what you said about the year, it looks like the rate of growth in aftermarket sales will be much more modest in the third and fourth quarter.', 'Could you give us some color on what you expect commercial and military aftermarket to do sequentially in the third and fourth?', 'And if thats the case, which it looks to be the mix would look like it would be a little bit leaner and yet your adjusted EBITDA numbers seem to assume very good margin improvement sequentially with a mix shifting towards more OE.', 'Help us understand that, if you could.', 'Certainly, the commercial aftermarket is the strongest driver of the growth.', 'Weve seen outperformance year-to-date, and we expect that to continue in the second half.', 'The visibility thats not -- its harder because youre looking at market data.', 'Youre not getting the actual orders in, its not a backlog business.', 'We may only have 45 to 60 days worth of orders visibility for that.', 'So I think there may be a little conservatism on what the mix will be.', 'We know what OEM rates are, they can change, but the aftermarket mix I think its stable moving forward.', 'Commercial is still strong.', 'Military usually has a big surge in Q4.', 'We see a lot of spares orders in our fiscal Q4.', 'But we dont provide guidance by market segment.', 'Wed like to tell you the trends, but sometimes one segment outperforms that helps cover underperformance in other segment.', 'Thats the benefit of our balance of diversification.', 'So basically, youre saying that the mix should be the same going forward?', 'Or is the mix shifting toward OA net-net?', 'I dont think its going to shift towards OE because the aftermarket is stronger in the fourth quarter, in particular, both for military and commercial.', 'So I guess theyre probably going to be more aftermarket in the second half of the year, but it depends on the OEM rate ramps.', 'At the moment, I think aftermarket is probably going to overtake and continue to be stable to increasing as a percentage of our sales.', 'And our next question today comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research.', 'Myles Alexander Walton So just actually a clarification on Cais question.', 'So the Slide 8, is that referring to that 11% growth in fiscal 24?', 'Is that referring to the whole channel of MRO or the commercial channel in insulation?', 'So we have about $152 million, I think, of sales, and thats the breakdown for the quarter of sales by aftermarket.', 'Its broken into third-party MRO where its not RIP necessarily and the spares, which obviously can be the highest margin.', 'And then the third pieces are IT, which are higher margin typically than repairs on third party.On the bottom of that page, you can see we have the Q2 and the year-to-date breakdown for all those components.', 'Myles Alexander Walton You mentioned the portal showing you 5.3% per month on the 77.', 'Could you also share what its looking at for the 37.', 'And maybe, Dan, that big growth youre anticipating in Interiors, I imagine thats primarily inflation driven on the 37.', 'Its one of the largest programs in Interiors for sure, but its certainly not the only one.', 'We have A220 work out of Airbus.', 'So its a mix of programs, but it is the largest.', 'On the OEM rates, Boeing has talked quite publicly about their step up to 38, whether its going to come in the calendar Q4, the following quarter.', 'But were building at rates that are approaching that now, and were typically, on average, about 1 quarter setback from them.', 'So as they ramp up, were already delivering into the pipeline, sometimes to intermediaries and then products that flow to Boeing.', 'So our factories are building at rates of 30 to 35 a month right now.', 'And in priming for rates that go up into 40 next year, or fiscal 25.', 'So thats the general MAX-737 outlook for us.', 'Airbus is a similar story.', 'Were building at rates that are in the high 40s and planning for rates for the 50s next year and 60s thereafter.', 'Myles Alexander Walton And just one last quick one.', 'When you mentioned portfolio actions in terms of pursuit of the balance sheet, improvement.', 'Could you elaborate on the size of any potential turning you might be looking at or business lines that you might be thinking about from that perspective?', 'Its one of these things every year.', 'Were looking at every business, trying to make sure were managing the portfolio for shareholder value.', 'But deleveraging is our top priority.', 'Debt reduction -- and so weve had inbounds for several of our businesses.', 'And one of the challenges is because were on a ramp across OEM and MRO, whats the value of these businesses.', 'You could understand that people would come calling when the rates have been depressed and were on the sort of, Ill call it, the base mountain climb of OEM and MRO rates.', 'So people who have interest in these businesses have to properly value them, but we want them to be needle movers for deleveraging, not just around the margin.', 'Our next question today comes from Michael Ciarmoli with Truist.', 'Michael Frank Ciarmoli Nice results.', 'Just to maybe go back, the DKL is pretty solid here on Slide 8.', 'And it looks like, I mean, spares were up 7% sequentially.', 'I mean can you maybe parse that out for us?', 'Was it more commercial?', 'Was it more military?', 'And kind of what youre seeing out there and what drove that level of spares activity.', 'It was more commercial this quarter.', 'And thats why I think the margin impact is a little less than you might see in some of the military spares.', 'But its lumpy business, as weve talked about before, where fortune was surged this quarter.', 'And the fourth quarter is typically when we see the biggest surge in the spares.', 'And there are opportunities to increase spares volume, which we continue to work on and increase spares pricing to cover increasing costs and enhance margins moving forward.', 'I know you have models for air traffic, but the ones we watched showed the first 10 months of U.S. traffic.', 'TSA volumes were above 2019 levels by 1.4%.', 'But more importantly, September and October, traveler throughput was up 5.7% over the year 2019 levels.', 'So its definitely ramping, and thats driving the carriers to invest in spares and repairs.', 'And the timing, you all commented on the strong commercial MRO sales.', 'As Jim mentioned, these fleets are coming out of service.', 'They hit their peak volume -- TSA volumes in July -- so theyre bringing them in for maintenance, and were benefiting from that.', 'Michael Frank Ciarmoli And then just -- I mean, you had been forecasting, I think 4% to 6% aftermarket growth, its now 11%.', 'Any -- can you give us any of the underlying military commercial?', 'Is it more spares, I mean, the IP sales look pretty flattish.', 'But maybe just what really drove that increase.', 'And I would imagine with the pratt issues, airlines flying some of these older planes longer has to help.', 'Well, weve been in touch with -- proud about ways we can help.', 'And its been a productive dialogue I would say right now, repairs are outpacing spares on the military side.', 'And that is going to, I think, revert as the depletion of U.S. stockpiles to support the various conflicts leads to orders for new spare hardware to replace those.', 'So these things tend to swing in their own cycles, repairs and spares, but thanks for the recognition of the progress on spares.', 'Last year, the spare sales were softer.', 'So were encouraged to see them coming back.Triumph does a lot of line replaceable units.', 'And thats really the beauty of the new portfolio is if you tour our plants, you see these actuators and heat exchangers and gearboxes.', 'And these are the items that are used up, consumed during operation and typically replace not a heavy maintenance but a frequent checks.', 'In terms of the mix of the driver of the increased growth as you can see, 2/3 of our aftermarket is repairs, 1/3 fares.', 'So its more repairs and spares and its probably a little more commercial than military for the back half of the year.', 'And our next question today comes from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America.', 'Just trying to understand what happened with the interiors duct work and the composite, if you can kind of go in more detail.', 'Like it seems like as of maybe last quarter that sort of came out of nowhere.', 'And I guess what Im worried about is, could this happen in another business or not?', 'Or I mean, how should we think about that?', 'And Im giving lots of inside baseball on interiors more than we ever have in the past.', 'But on composites, recall, we used to build these products, these ducts at our Spokane, Washington plant.', 'And we moved them to Mexico.', 'And at the time, a condition of transfer with Boeing is that we produce them in the same manner and we really missed an opportunity to relay out the line, add more automation.From their point of view, it was to avoid any changes that might lead to quality issues.', 'But now that weve stabilized production in Mexico, were going back to the line with Boeing partnership to take out further cost, and Im highly confident that were going to see the sort of productivity gains and composites that we saw -- that we do see today in installation.', 'This business has been a 20% plus business before and were focused on getting it back there, and we plan to exit this year with strong margins that are double digits on operating margins and then get it back into higher margins over our planning horizon.', 'And I would add, obviously, the cost challenges are multifaceted.', 'Theres inflation down there, thats been higher than we experienced in other countries.', 'Theres the FX headwind with the peso strengthening.', 'And then theres directed supplier costs that we can continue to work on because they have some sole-source directed suppliers.', 'And we have opportunities sometimes through adjustment clauses to recover that.', 'Sometimes we need to develop second sources or work to pass through the prices.', 'So theres lots of levers.', 'There was a -- it was a challenge, and it was a bit of a surprise in Q1, but were all over it and were going to improve it for the balance of the year.', 'And then, Jim, how are you thinking about -- I mean, really the refinancing that has to happen given where interest rates are now, I mean what -- you kind of alluded to theres maybe some creative things you could do.', 'Could you give us a hint to what youre thinking?', 'Well, as you know, opportunistics, so we continue to monitor the markets.', 'And if theres an opportunity to refinance that good cost in terms, we would consider doing that but were also improving the business dramatically, positive free cash flow this year, improving our credit.', 'So we dont want to move too fast that we dont get the benefit of our improved credit.', 'Weve recently seen -- I think Moodys upgraded our corporate family rating as well as our 25 bonds.', 'At the same time, were buying back with excess cash -- the bonds bought back at a discount, so we create a gain.', 'We reduced our interest expense.', 'Were going to continue to do that as we can with excess cash from cash flow from operations, from working capital liquidation.So were going to keep chipping away until it gets to a point where we can consider whether there are some delevering actions we can take with the portfolio, which weve talked about, or whether we want to refinance.', 'These arent due until August 25.', 'So they dont go current until next -- August next year.', 'But were keenly aware of it and were watching the markets.', 'So its not a big concern about refinancing, but we do want to delever.', 'So it would be best if we could just reduce that debt all together and not have to refinance.', 'And our next question today comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.', 'What is assumed in your 2025 and 2026 margin plan for the Interiors margin?', 'Im hesitating, no, because I dont know when we get into the margins of the segments, which we have given.', 'We said that -- this has been a 20% margin business in the past.', 'Ive said that this is easily back to the mid-teens on a normalized basis.', 'So you can imagine if were just coming out of September and breakeven-ish to look into -- with effect for the full year, have mid- to single high-digit on EBITDAP percentages, so you can expect to be in the double-digit percentages during those periods.', 'What Im most excited about is the growth in actuation and engine controls.', 'Actuation is going to hit, I think $500 million in sales this year and 20% plus on business with great aftermarket.', 'And engine controls is one thats getting a lot of that military MRO work and new wins on helicopters.', 'So even though Interior is getting a lot of headlines, its again, still 10% of the business.', 'But the core parts, what Ill call the crown jewels of the company, actuation, engine controls are really performing well.', 'Jim, the release and the presentation discuss debt -- recent debt reduction, but Im seeing a few different numbers, seeing a different number for the 2025s, and I thought was left there.', 'Can you just level set me on -- what did you pay down in the quarter?', 'What have you paid down since the end of the quarter?', 'And whats left on the 25.', 'So in the quarter, we paid down $19 million of the bonds.', 'And subsequent to the quarter, we paid down another $29 million of the bonds.', 'And back in Q1, there was warrants, $14 million of debt was retired as part of that process.', 'Unidentified Company Representative Take that off [$500], where were going to be right now.', 'And the -- it looks like youre saying on Slide 9 that, that action reduces interest expense and that flowed to the free cash flow guidance.', 'So it does reduce interest expense for the balance of this year, but on a full year basis, its $5 million.', 'So thats not in the year.', 'So this year is a piece of that and then a piece of just core business operations.', 'And then I guess related to that, thats a positive, but youve got the big 4Q where youre citing volume, which makes sense because of whats happening with sort of planned volumes.', 'But we -- you continue to operate in these end markets where the planned volumes are shifting around.', 'And so I guess, I was a little surprised you raised it given that, but at the same time, youre giving us these numbers halfway through the quarter here.', 'So I dont know whats the level of confidence in that number?', 'Or where is there a risk of something sliding out of the end of your year and into next year, on that free cash flow plan.', 'Were highly confident in our numbers, and we have a very detailed bottoms-up forecasting process by program, by site.', 'The risks come in the demand in the aftermarket, which we dont have long-term visibility, too.', 'And then, of course, OEM rates.', 'But I think its less on OEM rates as much as we talk about those with aftermarket being growing so much and being so important to the fourth quarter, thats where the risk is, its just demand.', 'And that demand is so diverse that I think its lower risk than a particular OEM rate schedule might be.', 'And working capital certainly is a big swinger, and were highly focused on that.', 'We ran dozens of lean events in October.', 'Were going to continue those through the second half of the year.', 'And were doing all the kinds of analysis on our material planning and work in process and finished goods and safety stocks and rotables and things that drive working capital.', 'So the rates do affect inventory burn down because the rates help us to draw up on whats on the shelf.', 'But thats one of the swingers as well, but were confident were going to make it.', 'And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes todays question-and-answer session and todays conference call.', 'We thank you all for attending todays presentation.', 'You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.']",['Q2 2024 Triumph Group Inc Earnings Call'],['Q2 2024 Triumph Group Inc Earnings Call'],"['Daniel J.

leads cargo airlines to pause fleet expansion.', 'The post Cargo airlines throttle back on aircraft leases, ATSG says appeared first on FreightWaves.']","['A number of freighter operators are starting to back out of, or postpone, commitments for upcoming aircraft leases, underscoring how the prolonged contraction in demand for air cargo shipping is squeezing cash flow across a wider cross-section of the industry.', 'Executives at Air Transport Services Group (NASDAQ: ATSG), a leading lessor of cargo jets that also provides cargo flying and other services, said Tuesday that weak interest from international airlines is a key reason why it lowered second-half profit guidance by $45 million and is taking a more conservative approach towards freighter investments.', 'The company presented a window into how pain from the freight downturn is spreading during an analysts briefing on its disappointing third-quarter earnings one day after the board of directors fired Rich Corrado and named its chairman, Joe Hete, as CEO.', 'Air Transport Services Group late Monday reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $137 million, 16% below the third quarter of 2022.', 'Other drags on performance included inflation, the conflict in Israel and unexpected maintenance.', 'The companys stock price dropped 23% on Tuesday and another eight points Wednesday to close at $14.32.', 'The stock is down more than 40% year to date.', 'Susquehanna Financial Group downgraded ATSGs stock to neutral because of the magnitude of the earnings miss against Wall Street expectations and the revised guidance, which likely will carry over into 2024.', 'Our new reality is that growth will be more difficult to achieve than before, said Hete, who once ran the company for 17 years and is tasked with shoring up results and investor confidence.', 'The markdown in second-half operating profit includes $24 million for the companys leasing business, Cargo Aircraft Management, because all-cargo airlines are scaling back on planned freighter leases.', 'The company now expects to deliver 16 newly converted freighters in 2023, three fewer than previously communicated.', 'It has commitments for 14 passenger-to-freighter conversions next year, two less than listed during the summer.', 'In mid-October, we were contacted by certain airline customers of CAM expressing that they were experiencing lower customer demand, which is negatively impacting their financial results and outlook, President Mike Berger told analysts.', 'The air cargo industry is undergoing rapid changes this fall.', 'Unfortunately, we are not immune to that.', 'Many carriers arent in a hurry to take aircraft as they would be in a more robust economic environment, CFO Quint Turner added.', 'According to Mexican aviation news outlets, mas Cargo Airline has parked both of its Boeing 767-300s to optimize operations around a uniform fleet of Airbus A330 freighters.', 'Mas leases the 767s from ATSG and was recently scheduled to receive another one.', 'Berger said mas hasnt returned any aircraft so far and ATSG expects the airline to honor its lease commitments.', 'The decision, however, indicates there wont be any future growth with that customer.', 'ATSGs biggest commercial customers are Amazon and DHL Express, which lease aircraft and pay ATSGs two cargo airlines to fly packages on their behalf.', 'Passenger charter subsidiary Omni Air International flies troops and other personnel for the U.S. government, accounting for about 30% of company revenues.', 'The leasing business is increasingly placing aircraft outside the U.S. with smaller operators, most of which function as contractors for global express operators Amazon, DHL, FedEx and UPS.', 'The parcel giants, with double-digit declines in volumes, are rationalizing oversized air networks and partner carriers are feeling the trickle-down effect.', 'ATSGs comments are further evidence that more all-cargo operators and lessors are pausing new orders and, in some cases, reversing course.', 'Earlier this year, Cargojet canceled plans to buy and convert four Boeing 777s and Air Canada told Boeing it no longer needed two factory-built 777 freighters.', 'Cargo airlines ABX Air and Air Transport International are flying fewer hours on long-haul routes for international customers, with overall cargo hours down 4% during the quarter, management said.', 'But both carriers are on track to meet full-year targets for adjusted pretax income.', 'ATSG, until the third quarter, had largely escaped fallout from the ongoing freight recession, which has seen air cargo volumes fall about 13% since the end of 2021, with rate declines of 40% to 50% for the majority of this year.', 'During the second quarter, revenue increased 4% and adjusted earnings were on par with the prior year.', 'And there were few signs of customer backpedaling, other than Vietnam Airlines quietly canceling plans for two Airbus A321 narrowbody freighters.', 'Company leaders said last summer they would time future aircraft purchases closer to when production slots for conversions open up.', 'But investors pressured the cargo-focused company to downsize capital expenditures because of deteriorating market conditions.', 'Management responded in August, trimming $65 million from the investment budget for 2023.', 'On Monday, the company went further, cutting 2024 capital expenditures to $505 million, $100 million less than mentioned in September and $280 million less than this year.', 'Executives said their hybrid business model, which includes maintenance and airport ground services, gives them the flexibility to hold off on acquiring feedstock and moving ahead with the conversion process as market conditions change.', 'Hete said the aviation firm is not sending additional 767-300s for conversion beyond the seven currently in process.', 'Six Boeing 767 passenger aircraft already purchased on the second-hand market will be parked until demand improves.', 'CAM can still generate income from those assets by leasing out the engines to other operators, loaning aircraft to Omni Air if there is demand for more passenger service or leasing aircraft to a needy passenger airline, he said.', 'Berger said ATSG still has its eye on long-term growth, reiterating the refrain that e-commerce growth and airlines need to replace older freighters justified capital spending.', 'Airbus and Boeing have forecast air cargo demand will grow at a compound annual rate of about 3.5% to 4% through 2040.', 'Changing operating behaviors in the passenger sector, including greater use of smaller jets with better fuel efficiency on longer routes and more point-to-point flying that bypasses airport hubs, could also increase shipper interest for dedicated freighters.', 'Berger said Asia will be a magnet for converted freighters.', 'A big part of our future is international.', 'And we are a global organization.', 'Were looking forward to that growth going forward, he said.', 'Uzbekistan-based My Freighter on Wednesday took delivery of its first 767 cargo aircraft, Turner confirmed to FreightWaves.', 'The lease was initially reported by Cargo Facts.', 'ATSGs revenues were impacted by the return of 11 Boeing 767-200s in the past year after their leases expired.', 'The planes are near end of life and more expensive to operate than 767-300s currently being marketed.', 'CAM intends to sell two of the fully depreciated planes this quarter and more next year.', 'ATSG is also adding the Airbus A330 converted freighter to diversify its midsize aircraft offering as the availability of used 767 passenger aircraft begins to dry up.', 'An Airbus facility in October inducted ATSGs first A330 for conversion.', 'Israel Aerospace Industries, the Tel Aviv-based company that turns ATSGs Boeing 767s into a cargo configuration, lost a substantial number of employees who are reservists to military duty when the war against Hamas started a month ago.', 'Berger said ATSG has been in constant contact with IAI and is confident the supplier can meet upcoming delivery schedules.', 'Forty percent of the reduction in projected profits is associated with Omni Air.', 'Management said the outbreak of war in the Middle East caused the Pentagon to pause troop rotations at a normally busy time of year while it monitors the need to adjust its force posture in the region.', 'Analysts criticized leadership for being caught off guard by the change in fortunes, especially after delivering a positive message at Investor Day on Sept. 27.', 'The disappointing third-quarter results compounded shareholders perception that the company has underperformed for years, and Corrado took the fall.', 'Executives responded that the 767 sales werent finalized as expected during the quarter and that a late maintenance issue stranded an Omni plane in Guam for three days, resulting in unexpected hotel costs for about 250 passengers and crew, as well as overtime pay for pilots.', 'A lot of the deterioration occurred late in the quarter.', 'And we did not have that visibility at the time, CFO Turner said.', 'The Israel conflict, which also weighed on guidance, came after the quarter ended, he added.', 'Hete acknowledged the need to improve financial results and reporting lines to top management.', 'We dont find it acceptable.', 'Rest assured that that is top of the list of getting back in terms of where the numbers we put out are credible to the market, he said.', 'We believe new (and former) CEO Joe Hete is the best person to manage ATSG through this difficult period, with his focus on maximizing returns and taking a more measured approach to growth strategically right-minded.', 'At the same time, with ATSG finally delivering an investor day approximately just six weeks ago and then sharply pivoting on its outlook, we believe its going to take some time before investors are again comfortable with the story, said Susquehanna equity analyst Christopher Stathoulopoulos, in a client note.', 'Executives, including Corrado, have long lamented that investors and analysts misunderstand ATSGs value proposition, noting that the ability to secure long-term leases, and carry out dedicated contract flying for e-commerce customers, differentiates the company from traditional cargo airlines wholly subject to volatile market forces.', 'Stifel transportation analyst Frank Galanti said the market is overreacting to the downward revisions in guidance given future requirements for midsize freighters and expects the company to soon outperform low expectations, which will improve the stock price.', 'Satish Jindel, CEO of parcel consultancy ShipMatrix, blasted ATSGs board for making Corrado the scapegoat for a profit shortfall during a prolonged freight recession that was out of his control.', 'Corrado was Hetes hand-picked successor and Hete was able to provide mentorship as chairman.', 'No one should get the blame.', 'Shareholders should not set the direction of a company because they can be in today and out tomorrow.', 'They have no allegiance, Jindel said.', 'If the shippers, the customers, were complaining and employees were complaining about Rich Corrado, then yes.', 'And the board should not be wrapped up in trying to please the shareholders.', 'Meanwhile, the federal government is mediating stalled contract talks between subsidiary Air Transport International and its pilots union.', 'Talks have broken down over work rules, retirement and compensation.', 'On Oct. 30, the Air Line Pilots Association opened voting to give union leadership authorization to call a strike when legally allowed.', 'The sides cant initiate self-help tactics until the National Mediation Board releases them from the mediation process.', 'ALPA says 207 pilots have left ATI so far this year, a third of the current pilot roster.', 'Hete acknowledged that ATI is experiencing attrition, with pilots taking significant hiring bonuses to join mainline passenger carriers.', 'Other cargo and regional passenger airlines face similar staffing challenges.', 'At the end of the day, youve got to have a contract that works for both sides.', 'So if youve got the union side asking for FedEx or UPS wages or industry-leading, and thats not in the cards from what we get from our customers, then thats just not something we can agree to.', 'So the key is finding a happy middle ground between their demands and our needs to keep things on the rails, said Hete.', 'Click here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.', 'Air Transport Services Group replaces Corrado, names Hete CEO Air Transport Services Group to lease 1st

its strong market position and a portfolio of well-established brands within the aerospace industry.', 'In addition to its dominant position in the industry, TDG has benefitted from the increase in US Federal budgets, the rise in international military conflict, and the recovery in commercial air traffic.', 'All this together led to a banner quarter for the aerospace engineering company.', 'TransDigm Group stock is up 8.5% on the day following this mornings report.', 'Quarterly Earnings Report All the bullish catalysts listed above had already alerted analysts to the strong current carrying TransDigm Group higher.', 'Even before the meeting TDG had a Zacks Rank 2 (Buy) rating, indicating upward trending earnings revisions.', 'But TDG still surprised to the upside even with the upgraded earnings estimates.', 'The company reported EPS of $8.03, 7% above analysts expectations and a 46% YoY gain.', 'Sales of $1.85 billion also beat estimates by 1% and showed a YoY increase of 23%.', 'In addition to being a steading earnings grower, TDG also prioritizes growing its Free Cash Flow.', 'I always like to see companies prioritize this metric, as it is one of the most explicit ways to measure a companys profitability, while also allowing for financial flexibility.', 'With growing cash reserves the company is free to pay down debt, reinvesting in the company technology or infrastructure and return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.', 'TransDigm Group stock has put up an almost unbelievable performance over the last 17 years, compounding at an annual rate of 28.5% over that time.', 'Consistent performance at this level cannot be overlooked and makes TDG a worthy portfolio holding through good and bad times.', 'Today, TransDigm Group is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 31.7x, which is above the market average and above its 10-year median of 27.3x.', 'While this is a premium valuation, it is worth noting that the company is forecasting impressive EPS growth in the coming years.', 'Over the next 3-5 years earnings are expected to grow at an annual rate of 25.7%.', 'This gives TDG a PEG ratio just above 1x, meaning it is likely right in line with fair value.', 'TransDigm Groups unique approach has set it up to be a truly standout company, demonstrated by its exceptional stock performance.', 'The company was founded in 1993 by a Private Equity firm, who saw an opportunity to combine four industrial aerospace companies.', 'TDG has maintained this approach, consistently acquiring new manufacturing businesses, thus expanding its range of components, while creating synergies between the businesses.', 'This clinical approach to capital allocation has played a critical role in engineering those phenomenal stock returns.', 'It also goes to show what kind of advantages an approach like this can create.', 'Although TDG has built out a very niche business with few relevant comparisons, it has dramatically outperformed its nearest competitors.', 'As for Aerospace companies, such as Boeing\xa0BA, the business economics are far less competitive than TransDigm.', 'Boeing is of course the more well-known company, who produces the final airplane product, but its stock has far underperformed.', 'It is clear that Boeing has an inferior business model, a concept investors must consider when picking

more flexibility when introducing, and iterating new products.', 'TransDigm Group is a compelling addition to any investors portfolio, and this quarters report further cemented that reality.', 'Furthermore, it is a fantastic example of what to look for when screening for long-term winning stocks.', 'The company flat out has better business economics than many others in the market, and if

converting two more aircraft into cargo jets as the weak cargo market shrinks profit margins.', 'The post Cargojet to sell off new B757 freighters, pause 767 conversions appeared first on FreightWaves.']","['Cargojet, which operates a nationwide air cargo network in Canada for e-commerce express companies plus international services, is moving more aggressively to cap fleet growth and preserve strong cash flows in response to the continued slowdown in shipping demand.', 'The airfreight specialist has a surplus of Boeing 757 converted freighters and recently listed four of them for sale, Chief Financial Officer Scott Calver said Tuesday during a conference call with analysts about third-quarter results.', 'The planes were recently converted and had their engines overhauled.', 'It costs about $5.2 million to remodel a 757 for cargo, not including millions more for acquisition, according to industry experts.', 'Until a sale is consummated, the planes are available for lease to other airlines and still will be used for charter work, Calver added.', 'The move follows an earlier decision not to proceed with converting four 777-300 passenger jets.', 'One of the planes was sold during the summer at a $1.6 million (CA$2.3 million) loss, and two were sold in the third quarter.', 'They were severely damaged in a hailstorm, which delayed their sale.', 'Cargojet (TSX: CJT) received $8.8 million from its insurance claim, but the amount didnt fully cover repairs.', 'The fourth 777-300 was never purchased.', 'Management also said plans to convert two Boeing 767 passenger jets it owns are on hold.', 'Cargojet has 39 aircraft in its fleet, up from 34 at the end of 2022.', 'More than half of them are Boeing 767 medium freighters.', 'It expects to have 41 aircraft by the end of the year after two 757s it purchased complete conversion to cargo configuration, and 46 by the end of 2025, according to company figures.', 'The Canadian carrier is moving forward with the passenger-to-freighter conversion of four Boeing 777-200s under a contract with aerospace startup Mammoth Freighters.', 'Cargojet will operate the planes for DHL Express, one of its major customers and a minority owner.', 'But if the 757s are sold off, the number of aircraft will stay nearly the same.', 'Executives said they hope to get about $87 million for the midrange freighters or will use the parts on other aircraft in the fleet if a buyer isnt found.', 'Air Transport Services Group, a U.S. aviation firm that provides aircraft leasing and cargo services, is also cutting back on capital expenditures for fleet growth because of down market conditions.', 'Executives this week said they have put on hold plans to convert seven used Boeing 767-300 passenger jets that were recently purchased.', 'Cargojet reported revenue in the third quarter declined 8% to $155 million, partially due to lower fuel surcharges, and adjusted earnings before accounting measures fell 17% to $50.6 million year over year, in line with analysts estimates.', 'The airline flew 8.8% fewer hours during the period versus last year.', 'Domestic revenues were marginally lower at $64.4 million due to a decrease in e-commerce and B2B volumes, partially offset by inflation adjustments in long-term contracts.', 'CEO Ajay Virmani said consumer spending on household essentials is offsetting declines in discretionary items purchased through online channels.', 'Revenue from long-term transportation services agreements and one-time charters was $45.4 million, 9% below the 2022 level, as the company realigned international routes to match lower demand.', 'Nonscheduled charter work has picked up, and the carrier is taking advantage of extra aircraft and crews to meet that demand.', 'Chief Strategy Officer James Porteous said a 9% reduction in revenue from long-term transportation contracts and one-time charters reflected a realigned international route structure with shorter stage lengths to match lower demand.', 'In 2022, when shipping demand out of China was still strong, Cargojet operated two dedicated aircraft for DHL from Shanghai to the DHL hub in Cincinnati via Vancouver, British Columbia.', 'Those aircraft were shifted to routes in North and South America when volumes declined late last year.', 'Optimizing routes is the primary way a cargo airline can reduce waste, but Cargojet has also combated revenue losses with what Virmani called a new culture of frugality.', 'That has led to reductions in overtime, training and temporary employees.', 'Cargojet is also selling two Beechcraft that were purchased for crew transportation.', 'Management said it projects peak season to be flat year over year, which likely means sequential growth in the fourth quarter of 10% to

'Meanwhile, Ethiopian Airlines said it was buying 31 aircraft from Boeing, including 20 737 MAX aircraft in a sign of renewed confidence in the single-aisle aircraft by the carrier after it suffered a deadly crash in 2019 with the airplane that led to its worldwide grounding.', 'Airbus has yet to strike a major deal at the show, which comes as global airlines like Emirates have bounced back from the lockdowns of the coronavirus pandemic with increased global demand for travel.', 'In his comments to journalists at the Emirates chalet on the runway of Al Maktoum International Airport, Clark raised concerns about the maintenance required for the Rolls Royce engines on the A350.', 'If the engine was doing what we want it to do ... then it would re-enter the mix of assessment for our fleet plan, Clark said.', 'But in a statement to the Associated Press, Rolls Royce said The A350-900 XWB-84 is the best engine out there when you look at efficiency, durability and reliability.', 'The Airbus A350 and Rolls-Royce Trent XWB have proven again and again to be a winning combination.', 'More than 56 customers have chosen to order and/or operate the aircraft which has set an industry benchmark for efficiency and reliability, the statement added.', 'Airbus did not immediately respond to a request for comment.', 'Emirates is a heavyweight when it comes to East-West travel out of Dubai International Airport, the worlds busiest for international travel.', 'Clark also said that Emirates needs to buy aircraft now as it moves forward with plans to expand its routes and networks.', 'Irrespective of the difficulties of getting these aircraft out of the door, we have to place orders now because the lead time for deliveries are so long, Clark said.', 'Clark also said that the tensions in the wider Middle East sparked by the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip wouldnt affect Emirates business, adding they are used to working around the regions geopolitical problems.', 'He said although the Israeli market was one of the fastest growing markets for Emirates, they had to stop their daily flights to Tel Aviv, Israel, but that the airline was able to absorb the demand fall-off.', 'Emirates and FlyDubai launched direct flights to Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv after the two countries established diplomatic ties in 2020.', 'Two major Israeli firms —

competition, however.', 'If Saudi Arabia wants to spend $2 trillion on doing wonderful things over there, theyve got to have the labor from somewhere.', 'And that labor force has got to be brought in, and their carriers are going to find it difficult in the early stages to meet that demand, he said.', 'So do I think its a problem with this lot?', 'No, I dont … because we managed to build Emirates through all of this competition, rising geopolitical socioeconomic difficulty.', 'The air show, which sees billions of dollars worth of deals, including by arms manufacturers, comes two weeks before Dubai hosts the United Nations COP28 climate talks.', 'Aviation has particularly drawn the ire of climate change activists, in part due to the amount of jet fuel the industry burns.', 'Emirates in January successfully flew a Boeing 777 on a test flight with one of its two engines entirely powered by so-called sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF.', 'Earlier this month, the airline cleared SAF for flights, including one to Sydney, Australia.', 'However, decarbonizing civil aviation is incredibly difficult and will be long term, Clark said.', 'On Tuesday, Ethiopian announced its deal with Boeing that will see it buy the 737 MAX aircraft, as well as 11 787 Dreamliners.', 'It also agreed to options to potentially buy another 36 aircraft - 21 MAX planes and 15 Dreamliners.', 'Boeing described it

people on board.', 'It was the second involving a Boeing MAX in less than five months and led to a worldwide grounding of all MAX jets for nearly two years.', 'Asked about the crash, Ethiopian Group CEO Mesfin Tasew said it has left a big scar in our memory.', 'We have checked and confirmed that the design defect of that aircraft has been fully corrected by Boeing and we have renewed our confidence in that aircraft, he said.', 'Other purchases Tuesday included: — Emirates announced $1.2 billion in deals with French firm Safran, including for seats.', '— Emirates announced plans for a

Allen McArtor, a former senior vice president at FedEx and administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration under President Ronald Reagan.', 'The emerging company took advantage of the airline sectors crash during COVID to structure very advantageous leases for mid-life aircraft at about half the going rate under normal market conditions.', 'GlobalX reported negative earnings, excluding non-core items, of $1.7 million in the third quarter, a $4.4 million improvement from the second quarter.', 'For the nine months ended Sept. 30, the hybrid carrier lost $13.2 million, $3 million more than the same period in 2022, before stripping out accounting measures.', 'With aircraft rent removed from the equation, earnings were $7.6 million.', 'The rapidly expanding fleet enabled the company to achieve record revenue of $42.6 million, up 38% from the year-prior period.', 'In its first full year of operation, Global Crossing generated $100 million in revenue and lost $15.8 million.', 'Starting an airline is expensive.', 'But executives stress they have laid the foundation for sustained profitability by scaling up the fleet and supporting infrastructure, including obtaining operating licenses and aircraft certifications in various jurisdictions.', 'They pointed to revenue growth outpacing costs for every expense line except maintenance as evidence of financial discipline and how continuing investments are making the airline more efficient.', 'And the growth in flight hours is faster than growth in maintenance costs, an indicator of improved efficiency.', 'During the quarter, the airline issued $35 million in bonds to repay current debt and provide capital for ongoing fleet expansion.', 'It previously raised $28 million.', 'Shareholders have been critical of the new financing terms of 15% interest, with a board seat and warrants for Axar Capital Management, but analysts viewed the deal as necessary to maintain the companys growth strategy and more favorable than equity financing.', 'GlobalX also reached an agreement with an airport developer for the financing and construction of a $25 million maintenance facility at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.', 'The facility, which is expected to open for occupancy in the second quarter of 2025, can hold three A320 variants or one A330-size aircraft.', 'Management said having its own maintenance capability will save money and drive efficiency because the airline will be able to control its schedule.', 'Buying hangar time to change an engine or do an overnight inspection at Miami International Airport (MIA) costs about $30,000 for an eight-hour period.', 'By the time the facility in Fort Lauderdale is ready, GlobalX will have 30 aircraft and many will be due for intensive maintenance checks.', 'The company has also invested in its own ground handling and fuel trucks to avoid having to rely on third parties that prioritized large customers and werent reliable.', 'GlobalX was experiencing two-to-three-hour delays because other fuelers at MIA prioritize serving American Airlines.', 'The leadership team says it is managing for long-term growth over quick earnings.', 'If we wanted to create a $150 million revenue company, we would be profitable today, said Chief Financial Officer Ryan Goepel during the earnings briefing.', 'But were building a $400- to $500 million-revenue company.', 'And the only way you can do that is investing in people, processes and systems.', 'Goepel, in other presentations, has said the companys goal is to have a $2 billion market cap in the next three to five years.', 'Airlines that dont grow, go bankrupt, added Wegel.', 'So we have no interest in operating a small airline because we will not survive.', 'Airlines with a larger base of aircraft and customers can better withstand external shocks.', 'GlobalX, for example, has doubled its pilot head count to 125 in the past year and fully expensed nearly $6 million to hire and train pilots during the quarter.', 'New pilots are on the payroll for 90 days before they start revenue flights.', 'Other building-block investments include flight dispatch technology and document management software to allow paperless functions.', 'The company offers three types of cargo service: on-demand, when a company urgently needs a shipment transported all-in contracts, in which a single customer charters the entire plane for multiple flights and long-term transportation service, in which the customer is charged a minimum number of flight hours and is responsible for finding cargo and paying fuel, ground handling and other fees.', 'The 2023 projected revenue ($150 million) share is 83% passenger business and 17% cargo, with cargo taking a larger slice in the future.', 'Management stresses that its cost-plus business model is much less risky than that of a fixed-cost scheduled carrier, which must operate whether the plane is full or not.', 'Every flight makes money, the company is paid in advance, fuel costs are passed through to customers, and unit economics continue to improve as block hours (flight and taxi time) increase.', 'Mid-2025 guidance is for cargo aircraft to generate $300,000 to $500,000 per month in earnings before non-operating expenses such as interest and taxes are counted.', 'Wegel scoffed at the notion that the air cargo market was currently too challenging for a new entrant to attract business, saying demand has simply reverted to the mean from the overheated days of the pandemic when anyone with a plane could make money.', 'Were not seeing any lack of demand on the narrowbody freighter side.', 'We are extremely busy flying for a whole host of different customers in the automotive markets, in the retail, he said.', 'In February, GlobalX began twice-weekly dedicated cargo flights to Havana for CubaMax, a travel and shipping agency based in South Florida.', 'Other customers include the U.S.', 'Postal Service, the West Indies Cricket team and Ascent Global Logistics, a GlobalX investor that owns USA Jets and specializes in moving auto parts from Mexico and Texas to U.S. assembly plants.', 'An HBO film studio earlier this year chartered GlobalX to move props and cameras for a shoot in Barbados and then back to New York two weeks later, Wegel said during a June interview at the companys Miami airport headquarters.', 'GlobalX freighters have made four circuitous trips to Israel, including two on Saturday, with more than 100 tons of medical and first-responder gear in the aftermath of the Hamas terrorist attack on Oct. 7.', 'It is one of the few U.S. carriers flying to Tel Aviv under war conditions.', 'On the earnings call, Wegel said staffing and supply chain issues at overhaul organizations that do the conversion work have delayed freighter deliveries, which are taking 10 to 11 months to complete instead of six to seven.', 'Modifications include adding a large cargo door in the forward fuselage area and a reinforced barrier wall in the upper deck to protect the crew cabin from shifting cargo.', 'Seats and other features designed specifically for passengers must also be removed.', 'Part of the problem, he said, is that the two conversion specialists for the freighter — 321 Precision Conversions and Airbus affiliate Elbe Flugzeugwerke GmbH — are still figuring out how to streamline the production process and which parts to preorder.', 'Production time is eventually expected to get faster.', 'A source at one of the rebuild specialists said A321 aircraft for multiple customers have been held up by overhauls of landing gear because vendors have had trouble getting parts.', 'Global Crossing is the only operator of the A321 converted freighter in North America, and executives are very confident the aircraft, which hit the market less than three years ago, is a rising star.', 'They insist it outperforms the Boeing 737-800, which entered the market about six years ago and has about 13% less volume.', 'Whenever we sit down with a potential client who is flying with a 737 or a 757 and we show them the operating performance of our airplane versus their airplane, we win that discussion every time, said Wegel.', 'He pointed to Lufthansa Cargo, Japan Airlines and Qantas as examples of large airlines that have also settled on the A321 for regional express routes.', 'The A321 beats the 757 with 18 more cubic feet of containerized payload capacity and burns about 19% less fuel, which translates to 300 fewer gallons on a long trip, according to the company.', 'It has room for 14 upper-deck containers, one fewer than on the 757, and 10 smaller containers in the lower hold.', 'But the 757 and 737-800 fuselages are too narrow for the LD3 containers and can only take loose cargo in the lower deck.', 'A321 proponents view the aircraft as the natural replacement for the aging Boeing 757 converted freighter, in large measure because containerized storage of high-volume, small packages is more efficient than manual exchanges of individual parcels to and from the lower hold.', 'For reasons having to do with schedule frequency, infrastructure, cost and ground handling, not all airlines utilize containers in the A321 belly.', 'Mike White, a consultant who for decades held cargo leadership positions at trade associations and airlines, said in an interview that the A321 is a good fit for North America, Central America and the northern tier of South America because of its range and cargo capacity.', 'Global X is waiting for final approval from authorities in Colombia for an air operators certificate that would enable it to establish a cargo airline in that country and serve the intra-Latin America market.', 'It would be one of the

of where do plane orders sit?', 'How does the timing of plane orders work when we see that kind of surge?', 'Its a great question demand is fantastic.', 'And so the reason for that is, if you look at what happened over 2021, 22, it was just really sort of slow delivery of planes.', 'And you saw the age of the average fleet stretch out quite a bit.', 'You know, I was at the Dubai air show recently.', 'And they booked a ton of new orders there.', 'And those new orders are really going to be fulfilled in the 2030S.', 'So when you think about what Boeing and Airbus are doing today, theyre trying to deliver aircraft that were contracted years ago.', 'And so I dont think you can correlate it as much with what you see on the day-to-day side for the airlines.', 'And just as an aside, I think air travel demand is actually going to be quite healthy next year.', 'You get a little bit of improvement on the corporate side.', 'And then I would imagine youll get a re-acceleration in leisure as we go into spring and summer.', 'So those things will matter as you think about new orders, because, ultimately, the airlines are going to need to produce their own free cash flow to ultimately purchase these aircraft.', 'But as long as the outlook, I think, remains OK, given the age of the average fleet, theres going to be quite a bit of demand to replace older aircraft.', 'JOSH

getting to 375 to 400 roughly on the 737 this year.', 'And so well be watching to see where it falls in that range.', 'But really, I think its-- as you think out into early 24 and you start seeing announcements perhaps from the supplier cohort about what Boeing and Airbus are asking them to get ready for.', 'And if we start to see those rate breaks, particularly on the 737 Max, go higher, I think, ultimately, thats going to be the catalyst people are looking for.', 'But as you noted, it was a great November.', 'And theres going to be some people starting to get curious about ultimately

Col. Becky Heyse said.', 'It was not immediately clear how the other services will adapt their missions.', 'QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CLUTCH The first Ospreys only became operational in 2007 after decades of testing.', 'But more than 50 troops have died either flight testing the Osprey or conducting training flights over the programs lifespan, including 20 deaths in four crashes over the past 20 months.', 'In July, the Marine Corps for the first time blamed one of the fatal Osprey crashes on a fleet-wide problem that has been known for years but for which theres still not a good fix.', 'Its known as hard clutch engagement, or HCE.', 'The Ospreys two engines are linked by an interconnected drive shaft that runs inside the length of the wings.', 'On each tip, by the engines, a component called a sprag clutch transfers torque, or power, from one proprotor to the other to make sure both rotors are spinning at the same speed.', 'That keeps the Ospreys flight in balance.', 'If one of the two engines fails, the sprag clutch is also a safety feature: It will transfer power from the working side to the failing engines side to keep both rotors going.', 'But sprag clutches have also become a worrying element.', 'As the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps began looking at HCE events following incidents in 2022, they determined that the clutches may be wearing out faster than anticipated.', 'Since 2010, Osprey clutches have slipped at least 15 times.', 'As the system re-engages, hard clutch engagement occurs.', 'In just fractions of a second, an HCE event creates a power spike that surges power to the other engine, which can throw the Osprey into an uncontrolled roll or slide.', 'A power spike can also destroy a sprag clutch, essentially severing the interconnected drive shaft.', 'That could result in the complete loss of aircraft control with little or no time for the pilots to react and save their Osprey or crew, Rivolo said.', 'In the 2022 crash of a Marine Corps MV-22 in California that killed five Marines, hard clutch engagement created an unrecoverable, catastrophic mechanical failure, the investigation found.', 'The fire was so intense it destroyed the Ospreys flight data recorder — another issue the Marines have pushed to fix, by requiring new flight data recorders to be better able to survive a crash.', 'OSPREYS HAVE BEEN GROUNDED BEFORE After Air Force Special Operations Command experienced two hard clutch engagement incidents within six weeks in 2022, the commander, Lt. Gen. James Slife, grounded all of its Ospreys for two weeks.', 'An undisclosed number of Ospreys across the military were grounded again in February 2023 as work began on clutch replacements.', 'But getting replacements to all the aircraft at the time depended on their availability, Slife said in 2022.', 'And even that replacement may not be the fix.', 'Neither the services nor defense contractors Bell Textron or Boeing, which jointly produce the Osprey, have found a root cause.', 'The clutch may be the manifestation of the problem, but not the root cause, Slife said.', 'In last weeks crash, Japanese media outlet NHK reported that an eyewitness saw the Osprey inverted with an engine on fire before it went down in the sea.', 'If eyewitness accounts are correct, Rivolo said, clutch failure and a catastrophic failure of the interconnected drive shaft should be investigated as a potential cause.', 'After its investigation of the 2022 crash, the Marine Corps made several recommendations, including designing a new quill assembly, which is a component that mitigates clutch slippage and hard clutch engagement, and requiring that all drivetrain component materiel be strengthened.', 'That work is ongoing, according to the V-22 Joint Program Office, which is responsible for the development and production of the aircraft.', 'A new quill assembly design is being finalized and testing of a prototype should begin early next year, it said.', 'WHISTLEBLOWER QUESTIONS Materiel strength was the subject of a whistleblower lawsuit that Boeing settled with the Justice Department in September for $8.1 million.', 'Two former Boeing V-22 composites fabricators had come forward with allegations that Boeing was falsifying records certifying that it had performed the testing necessary to ensure it maintained uniform temperatures required to ensure the Ospreys composite parts were strengthened according to DOD specifications.', 'A certain temperature was needed for uniform molecular bonding of the composite surface.', 'Without that bond, the components will contain resin voids, linear porosity, and other defects that are not visible to the eye which compromise the strength and other characteristics of the material, and which can cause catastrophic structural failures, the lawsuit alleged.', 'In its settlement, the Justice Department contended Boeing did not meet the Pentagons manufacturing standards from 2007 to 2018 the whistleblowers contended in their lawsuit that this affected more than 80 Ospreys that were delivered in that time frame.', 'In a statement to The Associated Press, Boeing said it entered into the settlement agreement with the Justice Department and Navy to resolve certain False Claims Act allegations, without admission of liability.', 'Boeing said while composites are used throughout the V-22, the parts that were questioned in the lawsuit were all non-critical parts that do not implicate flight safety.', 'Boeing is in compliance with its curing processes for composite parts, the company said.', 'Additionally, we would stress that the cause of the accident in Japan is currently unknown.', 'We are standing by to provide any requested support.', 'The V-22 Joint Program Office said that since the 2022 incidents, significant progress has been made toward identifying the cause of the hard clutch engagement.', 'While the definitive root cause has not yet been determined, the joint government and industry team has narrowed down the scope of the investigation to a leading theory, it said in a statement to the AP.', 'The leading theory involves a partial engagement of some clutches which have been installed for a lengthy period of time.', 'This has not yet been definitively proven, but the data acquired thus far support this theory.', 'Bell assembles the Osprey in a partnership with Boeing in its facilities in Amarillo, Texas.', 'Bell would not comment on last weeks crash, but said it works with the services when an accident occurs.', 'The level of support is determined by the service branch safety center in charge of the investigation, Bell spokesman Jay Hernandez said.', 'In its report on the fatal 2022 crash, the Marine Corps forewarned that more accidents were possible because neither the military nor manufacturers have been able to isolate a root cause.', 'It said future incidents were impossible to prevent without improvements to flight control system software, drivetrain component material strength, and robust inspection requirements.']","['Ospreys safety issue long grounded .',

[…]']","['In this article, we look at some of the most expensive fighter jets in the world.', 'You can skip our detailed analysis on trends in the aerospace industry and head over directly to the 5 Most Expensive Fighter Jets in the World.', 'Fighter jets play a significant role for militaries in securing control over enemy airspace.', 'These jets have evolved considerably from their earliest versions that were seen during World War II, to what we see now.', 'The first version of fighter jets, also known as the first-generation fighter jets, were recognizable for their straight and unswept wings, and their aircraft did not use avionics for communication and navigation.', 'The Me 262, built by German manufacturer Messerschmitt, was the worlds first operational fighter jet introduced in 1944.', 'Other prominent fighter jets during the era included Lockheed F-80, Gloster Meteor, and Heinkel He 162.', 'The second-generation of fighter jets catered to the need for more innovation, which resulted in jets being equipped with homing missiles and radars to improve the accuracy and managing aerodynamics, which was previously hard because of high speeds at which these jets traveled.', 'The third-generation jets came to be known for their multi-purpose roles.', 'Not only were they able to carry weapons, but also engage in aerial interceptions, and deploy missiles and bombs.', 'A major shift in technology and avionics came with the advent of fourth-generation aircraft that equipped fighter jets with infrared capabilities, maneuverability, fly-by-wire, and synthetic radars.', 'These jets were a major advancement in stealth and aerodynamics.', 'The most notable fighter jet of this era was the General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)s F-16 Fighting Falcon.', 'Fifth-generation fighters are the most advanced fighter jets currently in operation, and include using major technologies that were developed during the 21st century, such as stealth, supercruise performance, and low-probability-of-intercept radars.', 'These features made it hard for enemy radars to detect these jets.', 'Examples of fifth-generation fighter jets include Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)s F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II, Chengdu J-20 built by Chinas Chengdu Aerospace Corporation, and Sukhoi Su-57 used by the Russian Air Force.', 'Fighter jets are among the most expensive and potent military technologies that countries across the world are deploying to strengthen their defense.', 'Considering how much each aircraft costs, it is very likely that a big chunk of all defense expenditure of $2.24 trillion in 2022 was incurred on procurement of fighter jets.', 'For instance, Finlands military spending rose 36% between 2021 and 2022, and the increase was mainly attributed to the arms procurement, especially Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)s F-35 fighter jets, which made up nearly one-thirds of its defense expenditure that year according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).', 'Several Middle Eastern countries have racked up their defenses in recent decades and continue to spend heavily on advanced fighter jets.', 'The UAE, which received 80 F-16 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) as part of a $6.4 billion deal signed in 2000, has now placed an order for 80 Dassault Rafale F4 multirole jets from France worth $19 billion, which is the largest order ever placed for the French fighter jet.', 'In 2011, the United States and Saudi Arabia signed a $30 billion deal to provide 84 F-15SA aircraft produced by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA).', 'The Royal Saudi Air Force received the final delivery of these fighter jets in December 2020.', 'At the time of signing the contract, it was reported on CNN that the program would support 50,000 to 60,000 jobs across the US with more than 600 suppliers across 44 states being involved in making the aircraft for Riyadh.', 'The United States Air Force (USAF) launched a highly classified Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program in 2014 aimed at increasing the lethality of its fighter jets and to maintain aerial superiority.', 'The program plans on launching a sixth-generation fighter jet by 2030 to succeed Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)s F-22 Raptor.', 'The NGAD is estimated to cost $16 billion over the next five years between 2023 and 2028.', 'Approximately $1.7 billion were included by the USAF in their 2023 fiscal year budget request.', 'Their ask for FY24 is $2.3 billion.', 'In August 2022, five companies were awarded a $975 million contract each spanning ten years to work on the NGAD.', 'These included Lockheed Martin, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Pratt  Whitney, and General Electric.', 'Given the ongoing research and development on the future of fighter jets in the US, it is safe to say that America is likely to continue to rule the globe in this area of military power for the foreseeable future.', 'The United States has the most number of fighter jets in the world with 1,914, followed by China at a distant second with 1,199.', 'Russia holds the third spot with 773 fighters.', 'The 15 most expensive fighter jets in the world are ranked in ascending order of their estimated prices.', 'Data has been sourced from a variety of credible sources, including AeroTime, Flight Global, Shephard Media, and The Diplomat, among other news agencies.', 'Lets now head over to the list of the most expensive fighter jets in the world.', 'Price: $29-42 million Indias light multirole fighter jet, Tejas, was built by the Aeronautical Development Agency to replace the MiG-21 fighters.', 'It is one of the lightest aircraft in its class of supersonic fighters.', 'There are currently three variants of it, starting from $29 million, with the latest and most advanced version called Mk1A being priced at $42 million, as per reports in the Indian media.', 'Price: $40-45 million Sukhoi Su-57 is Russias first stealth fighter jet that has been designed to rival its American counterparts, F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II.', 'It is currently the most advanced aircraft in the Russian Air Forces fleet.', 'The unit cost of the fighter jet has not been made public by Russia, but it is expected to be between $40-45 million, according to a report in The Diplomat magazine.', 'In 2018, Yuri Borisov, Russias Deputy Prime Minister then, said in an interview that Moscow does not plan on mass-producing the Su-57 until Russias older fighter jets lag behind their western equivalents.', 'Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)s F-16 Block 70/72 is among the most advanced fighter jets from the fourth-generation class.', 'Cheaper variants of this light and maneuverable jet can cost as low as $30 million, according to AeroTime, but the advanced versions are costlier.', 'The Block 70/72 is the most up-to-date iteration of this fighter, and has an estimated price of $63 million per unit.', 'This version comes with superior avionics capabilities, and includes an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar and a modernized cockpit along with several other new features.', 'South Koreas defense sector, in 2022, received a significant boost after the successful first flight of its indigenous KF-21 Boramae fighter jet.', 'Manufacturers claim the advanced multirole fighter jet is stealthier than any other fourth-generation fighter jet.', 'The KF-21 Boramae is Seouls second locally produced fighter jet after the FA-50.', 'The Korean military is set to receive 40 of these jets by 2028, with each set to cost about $65 million.', 'Price: $67-70 million The F/A-18E and F/A-18F Super Hornet, developed by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), are variants of the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet series.', 'These supersonic, twin-engine fighter jets are equipped with M61A2 rotary cannon and can carry a variety of weapons, including the air-to-air-missiles and surface-to-air-missiles.', 'In addition to the United States Air Force, other primary users of The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet are Australia and Kuwait.', 'AeroTime estimates the per unit cost of these jets to be $66.9 million, while TS2 Space quoted it at $70.5 million.', 'The Shenyang FC-31 is Chinas prototype multirole fighter jet designed to serve the same purpose as western fifth-generation fighter jets, and can be used for various missions like ground attack, reconnaissance, and air security.', 'According to defense experts, Shenyang FC-31 is likely to be used as an aircraft carrier based naval fighter jet.', 'Its price is estimated to be $70 million, as per AeroTime.', 'The JAS 39 Gripen was known to be among the cheapest 4 or 4.5 generation fighter jets with its C and D variants.', 'That has now changed with the launch of its E and F versions.', 'These upgraded single-engine, supersonic fighter jets manufactured by Swedish defense company Saab AB are now one of the most expensive fighter jets in the world after improved radars, avionics, and its advanced weapon systems.', 'While prices may vary based on specifications, an average Saab JAS 39E/F Gripen can cost about $85 million per unit according to AeroTime, which is still significantly lower than Lockheed Martins F-35 and F-22 fighter jets.', 'The Sukhoi Su-35 is a highly advanced Russian multirole fighter jet, which is a significant evolution of the Su-27 after incorporating several improved features in avionics, maneuverability, radar systems, and weapon capabilities.', 'The Russian Air Force has 110 of these jets in its inventory.', 'The aircraft has also had immense export success, and continues to do so.', 'In 2019, China received 24 Su-35 fighter jets from Russia for $2.5 billion.', 'The Diplomat estimated the price per unit to be $85 million.', 'Last month, the Voice of America (VOA) reported that Iran had also finalized a deal to procure these fighters from Russia.', 'The number of units and monetary aspects of the contract were not disclosed.', 'Turkish stealth, twin-engine air superiority fighter jet, TAI KAAN, is being developed by the Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) to replace its fleet of General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)s F-16 Fighting Falcon.', 'The first ground running tests of the prototype of this combat aircraft were held in March this year.', 'According to the manufacturers, the TAI TF Kaan is likely to be priced above $100 million.', 'Price: $110-120 million Chengdu J-20 is a stealth fighter jet manufactured by the Chengdu Aerospace Corporation in China.', 'Designed as an air superiority fighter, it is also known as the Mighty Dragon, and is among the most expensive fighter jets in the world.', 'The J-20 made its first flight in 2011, before being officially revealed in 2016.', 'The aircraft entered service with the Chinese military in 2017.', 'It comes in three variants, J-20A, J-20B, and J-20S.', '12 Countries

find homes and cars.', 'These challenges are not going away as airline and aerospace executives remain cautious on supply chains and see problems persisting until 2025.', 'Meloches company in the

better incentives, recruiters say.', 'But they are not immune.', 'Business jet maker Bombardier, which has 17,000 workers globally and generated $6.9 billion in 2022 revenue, told Reuters it expects international recruitment will represent 10% to 15% of its Quebec production workforce hired in the next few years, an estimate that was not previously reported.', 'It currently employs about 9,400 in Quebec.', 'Airbus Canadian division said some of its recruitment needs must be met via immigration, while Boeing said the use of U.S. visas to bring in foreign workers is very limited.', 'Montreal-based Bombardier is taking on 40 new Moroccan workers with 40 more set to join, following its first international recruitment mission for trade laborers this year.', 'The company provides housing, paid flights and other perks.', 'Offering that kind of help is harder for smaller suppliers, which make up most of the 17 aerospace companies in Quebec that hunted for workers abroad in 2022,

apartments, AURAY client services manager Emilie Sauvé said.', 'For companies like Meloche that have had employees poached, or leave for jobs at planemakers, one benefit in hiring foreign workers under immigration rules is that they have to be loyal to the company theyre hired for, Sauvé said.', 'The small suppliers are drowning.', 'Hugue Meloche, who expects his business to generate C$135 million in 2023 revenue, sees recent economic headwinds easing the labor shortage, but recruitment of foreign workers will persist in Canadas aerospace hub.', 'Indeed, recruiters say Canadian aerospace companies use foreign workers more than their U.S. counterparts due to the availability of immigration programs that allow such hiring more easily north of the border.', 'But U.S. aircraft repair companies also consider foreign workers as an option, with a North American shortfall of aviation maintenance workers likely to hit 43,000 by 2027, according to consultant Oliver Wyman.', 'One U.S. trade association representing aircraft repair shops is weighing whether in-demand jobs like aircraft mechanics could be eligible for special visas.', 'AAR Corp, a Chicago-based network of

for foreign aerospace workers in the U.S. were not available from three government departments approached by Reuters.', 'According to Canadian government data for one nonimmigrant admission program, there were 125 temporary foreign worker positions for aircraft mechanics last year, compared with seven a year earlier and 66 in 2019.', 'There are a handful of programs in Canada used to recruit foreign workers, said Sauvé, adding she expects to see higher numbers this year and next as demand grows at her own firm.', 'The number of aerospace positions targeting international candidates grew

frames of mind thats been entered into.', 'And I think the other major thing here in the international week that has been for Boeing, huge order that they saw come through from Lufthansa as well.', 'And I think this all kind of points back years providing international travel demand environment that many of the airline CEOs have continued to point out to us as well.', 'SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Brad,

there has been some of the chatter here amongst analysts this morning.', 'Also, though, what this means for the 737 Max, because we know it has been just over four years since we have had this freeze of China not ordering any 737 Maxs from Boeing.', 'So this is seen maybe as a sign to a more significant or a bounce back here in terms of the 737 Max deliveries.', 'Jefferies is out with a note on this, or some commentary, I should say.', 'Theyre saying that they do expect that to happen after the 787 delivery in Beijing will be allowed, Shanghai is allowed here.', 'So we could see that very quickly what the timeline looks like of that, obviously, is what is up for debate.', 'We know the 737 Max very important here, in terms of what it does for their profits, the big boost that the 737 Max offers to its profits here for Boeing down the line.', 'So some optimism here in terms of what that order book could look like in the years ahead.', 'BRAD SMITH: Yeah, its expected to have a positive impact on the financials here.', 'You talk about potentially contributing $10 billion to its free cash flow target for 2025 to 2026.', 'These orders are placed years in advance.', 'So the resumption of delivery a big deal, but, also, as you mentioned, on the international relations front, especially for Boeing into some of these other regions.', 'And we should note that China, as well, with some of the stimulus that has been tossed around, or considered, going back into its economy, could mean and work wonders for the experience side of that economy, where Boeing and other airlines operating within the region would be net beneficiaries of more consumers.', 'Been on some of these new flashy aircraft, so Im just going to say.', 'SEANA SMITH: Yeah got to help them win more

indicated that the landing Japan Airlines A350 had permission to use the runway but the Japanese coast guard plane did not.', 'Safety experts are praising the airlines crew after everybody was able to escape the burning jetliner.', 'Five people on the coast guard plane were killed.', 'Composites have been used for many years inside commercial planes, such as the floorboards and other structures.', 'Boeing built the first commercial plane with a fuselage and wings made from composites reinforced with carbon fibers, the 787.', 'The plane went into airline service in 2011, and about 1,100 have been produced.', 'Airbus followed in 2018 with the A350 — like the two-year-old plane involved in Tuesdays collision — and has sold about 570 of them.', 'WHAT IS THE MATERIAL?', 'In airplanes, composite materials contain carbon fiber to give more strength to plastic and other materials.', 'According to Boeing, they produce weight savings of about 20% compared with aluminum — a significant amount, considering how much less fuel a lighter plane will burn.', 'The strength of composites was tested during certification by regulators including the Federal Aviation Administration, and Boeing said it made changes in the 787 as a result, but experts say there are limits to our understanding of the materials performance.', 'There has always been a concern about composites if they catch fire because the fumes are toxic, said John Goglia, a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates accidents in the United States.', 'That threat continues as long as the airplane burns — actually after, because those little fibers might be floating around in the smoke.', 'DID IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE?', 'While the Japan Airlines plane caught fire, filling the cabin with smoke, all 379 passengers and crew members were able to escape.', 'That fuselage protected them from a really horrific fire — it did not burn through for some period of time and let everybody get out, said safety consultant John Cox.', 'That is a positive sign.', 'Goglia said there is no real-world evidence on whether composite skins are any better or worse than aluminum at resisting fire and heat long enough to give passengers a chance to escape.', 'Aircraft manufacturers are supposed to show that their planes can be evacuated in 90 seconds with half the exits blocked, although skeptics question the accuracy of U.S. government-run tests.', 'On Tuesday night, video captured a fireball on the JAL plane as it continued down the runway after the crash.', 'The flammability issue is something they have to look at, but obviously nobody (on the jetliner) burned to death, said aviation attorney Justin Green.', 'It seems the fuselage and the seats (made of fire-retardant material) and everything else protected the flight crew and the passengers.', 'IS THE SMOKE ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS?', 'Passengers on the Japan Airlines plane said the cabin filled with thick smoke within minutes.', 'Videos posted by passengers showed people using handkerchiefs to cover their mouths and ducking low as they moved toward the exits.', 'There has long been concern about toxic smoke released when carbon-reinforced composites burn.', 'As far back as the 1990s, the Federal Aviation Administration said the main health hazards from composites present in plane crashes and fires were sharp splinters from exposed material, fibrous dust, and toxic gases generated from burning resins.', 'From early reports, it appears that there was a significant amount of smoke in the cabin, and it is not yet clear if any of the smoke was from burning composites, said Todd Curtis, a former Boeing engineer who is now a safety consultant.', 'Curtis said a key follow-up for investigators and regulators will be monitoring whether passengers or firefighters were injured by exposure to toxic smoke from the burning composite.', 'Those injuries could take a long time to show up, said Steven Marks, an aviation attorney.', 'He said passengers involved in accidents are usually in shock and often dont immediately recognize the severity of their injuries.', 'WAS THE FIRE HARDER TO PUT OUT?', 'Another concern, experts said, was the amount of time it took firefighters at Haneda to extinguish the blaze, and the risk to the first responders.', 'Curtis, the former Boeing engineer, said both in the Haneda crash and a 2013 fire on an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 787 that was parked at Londons Heathrow Airport, putting out the fire took much more effort than with a typical airliner fire.', 'The official report said the fire at Heathrow started with crossed wires in the planes emergency locator transmitter, but added, The resin in the composite material provided fuel for the fire, allowing a slow-burning fire to become established in the fuselage crown.', 'Curtis said that incident made him worry about fuselage fires on the ground and in the air back in 2013, and these concerns have not gone away.']","['jet carbon-composite fiber fuselage burned Tokyo runway .', 'material safe ?']","['fuselage jetliner involved collision Tokyo runway made carbon-composite fiber , incident renewing

what has been a long line of safety and quality control questions about Boeing aircraft.', 'Stunningly, no one was killed or seriously injured when a piece of the plane ripped out of the side of the fuselage only a few minutes into the flight from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, sending some of the contents of the plane hurling into the void.', 'Its fortunate that nobody died and there were not more serious injuries,\xa0Jennifer Homendy, chair of the National Safety Transportation Board (NTSB), told CNN.', 'Investigators continue to comb through data and eyewitness accounts and examine the jet itself.', 'Early details from the NTSB are harrowing: Homendy said that the headrests from seat 26A — which is immediately next to the refrigerator-sized hole in the planes left side — as well as seat 25A in front of it, were missing.', 'Seats structures are twisted, Homendy said, oxygen masks are dangling and there is a piece of clothing caught up in the hole by the missing door plug that separated from the airplane.', 'The video looks very calm, but Im sure it was completely chaotic and very loud, Homendy said, referring to videos taken by passengers.', 'The cause of the accident has not been determined.', 'The planes auto pressurization fail light had illuminated three times in the past month, Homendy said, noting it is unclear if there is any correlation between the warning lights and the Friday incident.', 'On Monday, United Airlines said it found loose bolts on the same part of an undisclosed number of its 737 Max 9 planes.', 'The airline said the problem appears to be an installation issue.', 'As operators conduct the required inspections, we are staying in close contact with them and will help address any and all findings, Boeing said in a statement.', 'We are committed to ensuring every Boeing airplane meets design specifications and the highest safety and quality standards.', 'We regret the impact this has had on our customers and their passengers.', 'But the Alaska Airlines plane was put into service in October.', 'The fact that the plane is essentially brand new suggests it could ultimately be Boeings fault and not the maintenance crew at Alaska Airlines, said Richard Aboulafia,\xa0managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace and defense management consultancy based in Michigan.', 'Boeing 737 MAX 9 planes grounded after Alaska Airlines emergency landing, leading to travel delays and cancellations The only good news for Boeing is that its almost certainly not a design issue, said Aboulafia.', 'But that doesnt absolve the aircraft maker, he said.', 'That leaves us almost certainly with the production process, he said.', 'Boeing said it agreed with the Federal Aviation Administrations (FAA) decision to ground all 737 Max 9 planes while they are inspected.', 'On Monday, Boeing said it sent airlines and maintenance companies instructions on how to inspect the planes.', 'The FAA, Boeings primary regulator, faces intense scrutiny of its own over a recent series\xa0of airline delays and near misses between planes, as well as criticism for giving aircraft makers too much freedom to regulate themselves during the certification process.', 'But the company, for five years, has faced repeated quality and safety issues with its aircraft, leading to the long-term grounding of some jets and the halt in deliveries of others.', 'Boeings (BA) stock tumbled nearly 9% in premarket trading Monday as investors grow concerned about more damage to its business.', 'The most glaring quality problems for Boeing came with the 737 Maxs design, which was judged to be responsible for two fatal crashes: one in Indonesia in October 2018 and the other in Ethiopia in March 2019.', 'Together, the two crashes killed all 346 people aboard the two flights and led to a 20-month grounding of the companys best-selling jets, which cost it more than $21 billion.', 'But the design flaws that caused the crashes brought to light questions about the decision making process at Boeing.', 'Internal communications released during the 737 Max grounding showed one employee describing the jet as designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.', 'Two other employees agreed that they would not allow their family members to fly on the plane.', 'Boeings release of the documents included an apology to the FAA, Congress, airlines and their passengers.', 'The company said it would hold an all-employee meeting on Tuesday focused on safety at the 737 Max factory in Renton, Washington.', 'On Monday, the company sent a memo to staff, encouraging people to think about safety by: Asking ourselves what we can do individually and collectively to make safety and first-time quality the priority in all aspects of our business.', 'The problems with the Max are only part of the quality control issues that have dogged the company.', 'It had to twice halt deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner, for about a year starting in 2021 and again in 2023, due to quality concerns cited by the FAA.', 'And the 777 jet also suffered a grounding after an engine failure on a United flight scattered engine debris onto homes and ground below.', 'Some of those problems, such as the engine issues on the 777, were attributed to Boeing suppliers.', 'But Boeing has worked to cut the costs it pays suppliers in recent years, such as those that make its fuselages and engines.', 'Aboulafia suggested that effort could have contributed to the series of quality control problems with its planes.', 'The company did not respond to a request for comment on whether the Alaska Airlines flight was linked to Boeings recent quality problems.', 'The problem with the Alaska Airlines 737 Max flight isnt the first problem since the plane was returned to service three years ago following the grounding.', 'Just this past December, Boeing asked airlines to inspect all of their 737 Max jets for a potential loose bolt in the rudder system, after an airline discovered a potential problem with a key part on two aircraft.', 'Whenever a new problem occurs, Boeing insists that safety and quality are the companys number one priority.', 'Safety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers, said Boeing after the Alaska Airlines accident.', 'It wasnt long ago that Boeing had an unmatched reputation for quality and safety.', 'If its not Boeing, Im not going, used to be an expression to express the trust passengers and airline crews placed in the aircraft makers quality.', 'Boeing still sells T-shirts and coffee mugs bearing that expression, which no longer rings true for many passengers.', 'Its not easy to say when things started to change at Boeing.', 'Some aviation industry experts point to a 1997 merger with McDonnnell Douglas that eventually gave the company top executives who were not former engineers as past Boeing leadership had been.', 'Others point to the decision to move corporate headquarters away from its Pacific Northwest roots, first to Chicago in 2001 and then to Arlington, Virginia, in 2022, near the Pentagon and across the Potomac from Washington, DC.', 'And Boeings quality control problems havent been limited to its commercial aircraft unit.', 'Many of its military aircraft have also had quality issues that required the company to take large charges against earnings.', 'The most-high profile of those problems includes two new 747 jets being reconfigured to be the next Air Force One presidential jets.', 'Boeing has disclosed more than $2 billion in losses on those two planes alone.', 'Its space efforts badly trail those of Elon Musks upstart SpaceX, as its Starliner spacecraft designed to carry astronauts to and from the International Space Station has yet to have a crewed flight because of a series of errors, delays and failures.', 'Its first crewed flight is now scheduled for later this year, but that would come four years after SpaceX first carried astronauts to the space station.', 'As recently as 2019, the company was reporting strong sales and profits, topping $100 billion in revenue for the first, and maybe only, time in its history.', 'But it has fallen badly behind rival Airbus since then, especially in the key market for single-aisle jets, such as the 737 Max.', 'Some problems are beyond its control, such as the China-US trade tensions killing demand for its jets in the crucial China market.', 'But many of these quality problems have angered airline customers, which have grown frustrated by the delays and groundings affecting their own expansion plans.', 'In 2022, Michael OLeary, CEO of Ryanair, Europes largest discount carrier and a key Boeing customer, let loose a public expletive-filled rant at Boeing management, saying they needed to get their s*** together and that company executives need either an immediate reboot, or a boot up the a**.', 'The delivery and production problems have resulted in the company reporting only one profitable quarter since 2019, and its not clear when it will report an annual profit again.', 'The fact that Boeing and Airbus are the only two major global aviation companies means that Boeing probably doesnt have to worry about being forced out of business, no matter how extensive its mistakes.', 'Neither company could accommodate all commercial aircraft demand, and both have a backlog of orders stretching back years.', 'But the problems have meant that Boeing continues to fall further behind Airbus.', 'Boeing had to postpone plans for its next-generation jet, popularly known as the Boeing 797, which was supposed to offer airlines a mid-size, long-distance jet to compete with the Airbus A321XLR.', 'And it has delayed plans to begin production of the next version of the 777, the 777X, which was originally due to start delivery to customers by the end of last year.', 'Now Boeing wont be delivering the

(AP) — The decision by Alaska Airlines to stop flying one of its planes over the Pacific Ocean to Hawaii due to warnings from a cabin-pressurization system — yet keep flying it over land — is raising questions about whether the jet should have been in the air at all.', 'The nations top accident investigator says warning lights were triggered on three flights, including each of the two days before the brand-new Boeing 737 Max 9 suffered a terrifying fuselage blowout Friday night.', 'A plug covering a spot left for an emergency door tore off the plane as it flew 16,000 feet (4,800 meters) above Oregon.', 'Jennifer Homendy, chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, said maintenance crews checked the plane and cleared it to fly — but the airline decided not to use it for the long route to Hawaii over water so that it could return very quickly to an airport if the warning light reappeared.', 'Fridays flight was headed from Oregon to Southern California, and made it back to Portland without serious injury to any of the 171 passengers and six crew members.', 'But the decision to allow it to fly over land in the first place struck some aviation experts as illogical.', 'If you are afraid to take the airplane far from land, what is the reason for that?', 'That has to be answered by Alaska Airlines, said Steven Wallace, an air-safety consultant and commercial pilot who once headed accident investigations for the Federal Aviation Administration.', 'The FAA grounded all Max 9s operated by Alaska and United and some flown by foreign airlines for inspection after the Friday night flight.', 'The inspections are focused on plugs used to seal an area set aside for extra emergency doors that are not required on United and Alaska Max 9s.', 'Monday afternoon, United Airlines said it found loose bolts and other installation issues on door plugs that were inspected after the Alaska Airlines incident.', 'Since we began preliminary inspections on Saturday, we have found instances that appear to relate to installation issues in the door plug — for example, bolts that needed additional tightening, Chicago-based United said.', 'Boeing, which has had its own share of problems with various planes over the years, pledged to help address any and all findings that airlines make during their inspections.', 'The FAA declined to comment on whether the Alaska Airlines plane in question should have been allowed to keep flying.', 'The agency said it would be premature to comment while the NTSB is investigating the Friday night flight.', 'Seattle-based Alaska Airlines also declined to comment, saying it would need permission from the NTSB to discuss the plane and its maintenance history.', 'We will provide information as soon as the NTSB permits us to do so, the airline said.', 'Alan Diehl, a former crash investigator for both the NTSB and the Federal Aviation Administration, said Alaska should have grounded the plane, period.', 'However, he and other critics said the decision to stop flying the plane to Hawaii might have averted a disaster.', 'If the blowout had happened halfway to Hawaii, pilots would have been forced to fly low enough so passengers could breathe without oxygen masks, which burns more fuel.', 'And the gaping hole in the fuselage would create drag.', 'The plane might have run out of fuel before reaching land, experts said.', 'As far as Im concerned, theres an angel in Alaska, Diehl said.', 'Whoever made the decision to do that probably saved a lot of lives.', 'Other aviation insiders saw nothing unusual in the airlines decision to limit but not ground the plane after the pressurization warnings on flights Dec. 7, Jan 3 and Jan. 4 — the day before the blowout.', 'Whatever maintenance they performed on it, (they decided) Lets be conservative and not put this thing out over water, said John Cox, a former airline pilot and now a safety consultant.', 'He said the intermittent nature of the pressurization warnings – three out of the planes 145 flights – might have made them suspect a bad sensor or something else.', 'Its not clear whether the airline would have been required to report the warning lights to the FAA or the fact that it had limited the plane to flying over land.', 'Wallace said rules about such reporting arent specific.', 'Homendy, the NTSB chair, cautioned that the pressurization warning light might be unrelated to Fridays incident, which occurred as the plane cruised about 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) over Oregon.', 'On Monday, the FAA approved guidelines for inspecting the door plugs on other Max 9 jets and repairing them, if necessary.', 'That move could speed the return to service of the 171 planes that the FAA grounded.', 'Alaska has 64 other Max 9s, and United Airlines owns 79 of them.', 'No other U.S. airlines operate that model.', 'The NTSB said the lost door plug was found Sunday near Portland in the back yard of a home.', 'At a news conference Sunday night, Homendy said an explosive rush of air damaged several rows of seats and pulled insulation from the walls.', 'The cockpit door flew open and banged into a lavatory door.', 'Two cellphones that appeared to have belonged to passengers on Fridays flight were found on the ground.', 'One was discovered in a yard, the other on the side of a road.', 'Both were turned over to the NTSB.', 'Grounding 171 of 218 Max 9s in operation, including all those used by Alaska and United, led to flight cancellations at both carriers.', 'Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun called a companywide webcast to talk about the incident with employees and senior leadership for Tuesday.', 'Alaska Airlines flight 1282 took off from Portland at 5:07 p.m. Friday for a two-hour trip to Ontario, California.', 'About six minutes later, the chunk of fuselage blew out.', 'Videos posted online by passengers showed a gaping hole where the paneled-over door had been.', 'They applauded when the plane landed safely about 13 minutes after the blowout.', 'Firefighters came down the aisle, asking passengers to remain in their seats as they treated the injured.', 'It was extremely lucky that the airplane had not yet reached cruising altitude, when passengers and flight attendants might be walking around the cabin, Homendy said.', 'The Max is the newest version of Boeings venerable 737, a twin-engine, single-aisle plane frequently used on U.S. domestic flights.', 'The model went into service in May 2017.', 'Two Max 8 jets crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people.', 'All Max 8 and Max 9 planes were grounded worldwide for nearly two years until Boeing made changes to an automated flight control system implicated in the crashes.', 'The Max has been plagued by other issues, including manufacturing flaws.', 'Koenig reported from

No passengers were seriously injured in the incident, which occurred as the Boeing 737-9 Max was 16,000 feet off the ground, and the pilots managed to safely land it back at the Portland airport shortly after.', 'The event has raised a number of questions.', 'The most crucial is just how this kind of failure, in which a door plug installed to replace an emergency exit was ejected out of the side of the pressurized cabin, could occur in a commercial plane.', 'Federal regulators at the National Transportation Safety Board are actively investigating the incident but have not yet announced any findings.', 'Read more: A loud boom, a blast of icy wind and sheer terror on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 But what exactly is a door plug in the first place?', 'How did the cockpit voice recording end up being erased before anyone could listen to it?', 'The Boeing 737-9 Max has been grounded worldwide pending the results of the investigation, but how can you figure out what plane your flight is going to be on in the future?', 'And how exactly did an iPhone that got sucked out the gaping hole in the plane survive the fall to Earth?', 'These questions, at least, can be answered.', 'The part of the plane fuselage that failed Friday was called a door plug and is not unique to the 737-9 Max or other Boeing planes.', 'The number of required emergency exits changes based on the number of passengers a plane can hold.', 'The original design of the 737-9 Max had two additional emergency exits toward the rear of the plane, in addition to the exits over the wings, at the rear, and near the cockpit.', 'Some international customers of the 737-9 Max have been flying the planes at maximum capacity, which requires all the original emergency exits in place.', 'Read more: Alaska Airlines flight: Cockpit audio is lost, and a mysterious warning light is investigated Alaska Airlines opted to fly its 737-9 Maxes with fewer passengers, which meant it didnt need those additional emergency doors.', 'Robert Ditchey, an aviation expert and former airline executive, explained the logic behind replacing the doors with a plug.', 'One would think the more the merrier when it comes to emergency exits, Ditchey said, but exit doors with embedded slides or life rafts add weight to a plane and cost extra to maintain over the life of the craft.', 'After the airline ordered the modified plane, the company that manufactures its fuselage, Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kan., took out the original door and added the door plug in.', 'That modified fuselage was shipped to Boeing fitted but not completed, according to Reuters, which allows Boeing to remove the plug and use the hole in the side to access the cabin of the plane, in order to install interior components.', 'Boeing ultimately reattached the door plug in its facility, then delivered the craft to Alaska Airlines.', 'The NTSB has yet to determine the specific cause of the failure, but one possible culprit is some flaw in the bolts that were holding the door plug onto the rest of the airframe.', 'On Monday, United Airlines announced that it had found loose bolts and other installation issues on the door plugs of its own 737-9 Max planes.', 'We dont know what failed, Ditchey said, mentioning the possibility that some bolts could have been missing, the wrong size, improperly tightened, or could have mechanical flaws in the metal.', 'He added that there could have been a structural failure in the frame of the craft, but said that he thinks that less likely.', 'In his view, this points to a design flaw in the door plug itself.', 'The doors in a commercial plane are designed specifically to be un-openable while the cabin is pressurized, and designed to withstand the pressure of the cabin.', 'Even without bolts or a latch holding it in place, a passenger would not be able to open the emergency exit on a plane that was fully pressurized.', 'To ensure that they cant blow out, like the door plug on the Alaska flight, they are built like wedges: larger on the inside than the outside, so the cabin pressure fits them snugly into place.', 'Read more: Truly terrifying: Investigators describe the blowout aboard an Alaska Airlines flight The plug is in my opinion a bad design, because it can blow out and did blow out in this case, Ditchey said, since it appears to have been bolted on from the outside, rather than wedged against the frame from within.', 'That troubles me greatly.', 'Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems said that they could not comment on the specifics of the door plug assembly given the ongoing NTSB investigation into the failure.', 'Accidents over the last half a century in which the airplane cabin depressurized have been mostly attributable to baggage hold door failure, particularly with the now-obsolete DC-10 airliner, and fuselage metal fatigue, rather than failures in the main cabin doors.', 'When Jennifer Homendy, chair of the NTSB, spoke about Fridays incident at a news conference over the weekend, she brought up a very specific frustration: The cockpit voice recorder in the plane had automatically erased the recording from the incident.', 'Nobody turned the recorder off for safekeeping, and they are programmed to retain only the most recent two hours of audio, which is then automatically overwritten.', 'As The Times reported: Homendy was visibly exasperated by the loss of the black box recording.', 'She noted that it was a very chaotic event when the plane landed and officials set up an emergency operations center.', 'The maintenance team went out to get [the cockpit voice recorder], but it was right at about the two-hour mark, she said, later adding: We have nothing.', 'The two-hour setup of the recorders strictly follows FAA guidelines, but proposed rules would extend the recording time to 25 hours, in line with current European regulations.', 'Most airlines show the type of plane that youll be flying in when you view the flight information on their booking site.', 'Third-party websites such as FlightAware and FlightStats also show the model of plane being used for a given flight.', 'Airlines that have purchased the relatively new 737-9 Max have grounded the plane for the time being, though, so theres no risk of getting on a similar model to the plane in Fridays incident.', 'The earlier version of the 737 Max, the 737-8, is in wide use in airline fleets around the world but has a notable blemish on its safety history — those planes were grounded in 2019 after two deadly crashes that killed 346 people, but they were deemed safe to fly in 2021 and have been in heavy use since.', 'As Sean Bates took a walk around his home on Sunday, he stumbled upon a remarkable artifact of Fridays accident: the iPhone of a passenger that had been sucked out the hole in the plane.', 'The phone appears to have been found in the grass, which made for a soft landing, but still: Three miles is a pretty long way to fall.', 'Luckily, a little physics provides the answer.', 'All objects have a certain terminal velocity that they reach when falling through the air, based on how their size and weight interact with wind resistance.', 'Small, heavy objects reach a higher terminal velocity than big, lightweight ones — think a baseball versus a piece of paper.', 'As Wired calculated in an article in 2011 after another incident of an iPhone surviving a fall from the skies, the small weight of the handset means that its speed when falling maxes out at between 27 and 95 mph, depending on whether its tumbling, falling flat or falling edge-down.', 'As anyone with an iPhone can attest, even a much shorter drop can be fatal for the phones when the target is a concrete sidewalk, but with spongy grass serving as a shock absorber, the iPhone (apparently) just didnt pick up enough speed to be smashed to smithereens.', 'It cant hurt that the unlucky passenger had their phone in a protective case.', 'At Sundays news conference, NTSB Chair Homendy said that the agency had recovered the chunk of airplane from the backyard of a home in Portland, Ore., after the agency was notified by a schoolteacher named Bob.', 'Thank you, Bob, Homendy said.', 'The agency later posted a photo of the debris on its Twitter account.', 'NTSB has recovered the door plug from Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 Boeing 737-9 MAX.', 'NTSB investigators are currently examining the door plug and will send it to the NTSB Materials Laboratory in Washington, DC for further examination.', 'pic.twitter.com/fqeemNeBPW — NTSB Newsroom

of events that led to the blowout Friday night, but they dont know the cause.', 'A key question is whether bolts used to help secure the panel, called a door plug, were installed.', 'A National Transportation Safety Board investigator says the bolts have not been recovered and the agency wont know if they were even in place until the door plug is examined in a laboratory.', 'Adding to Boeings problems, Alaska Airlines and United Airlines — the two U.S. carriers that fly the Max 9 — reported finding loose bolts and other hardware in other panels, suggesting quality issues with the door plugs are not limited to one plane.', 'The plugs are installed in Max 9 fuselages by subcontractor Spirit AeroSystems, which was spun off by Boeing in 2005.', 'Spirit has a history of manufacturing problems, many uncovered in a U.S. House probe of two fatal crashes involving Boeing 737 Max 8 planes.', 'The focus needs to turn to Spirit, said former congressman Peter DeFazio, who chaired the investigating committee.', 'Boeing has been happy with the crappy stuff from Spirit because its cheap.', 'The company said in a statement Monday that quality and product integrity are a priority.', 'Spirit is a committed partner with Boeing on the 737 program, and we continue to work together with them on this matter, it said.', 'The process of inspecting Max 9s and returning them to service has been slower than Alaska and United had hoped.', 'The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all Max 9s in the United States on Saturday until they could be inspected, but Boeing didnt provide inspection instructions until Monday.', 'On Tuesday, the FAA said those instructions were being revised because of feedback, and it extended the grounding of the planes.', 'The safety of the flying public, not speed, will determine the timeline for returning the Boeing 737-9 Max to service, the FAA said in a statement.', 'However, the inspection delays threw airline schedules into turmoil.', 'United said it canceled another 170 flights Tuesday because of the grounding.', 'Alaska said it scrubbed 109 flights because it couldnt fly Max 9s.', 'The part that failed on the Alaska flight is installed on some Boeing jets when airliners dont have enough seats to require more emergency exits.', 'The plugs are lighter than an aircraft door, reducing the planes weight and saving fuel.', 'They are common on cargo planes that have been converted from passenger use.', 'During a briefing late Monday, NTSB officials described how the plug on Alaska flight 1282 rolled upward and flew off the jet.', 'Four bolts and 12 connecting points between the plug and the door frame are supposed to prevent that from happening.', 'We have not yet recovered the four bolts that restrain (the plug) from its vertical movement, and we have not yet determined if they existed there, said NTSB aerospace engineer Clint Crookshanks.', 'That will be determined when we take the plug to our lab in Washington, D.C.', 'It is not clear whether Spirit AeroSystems or Boeing technicians last worked on the door plug, which can be opened for maintenance.', 'Steven Wallace, former head of accident investigations for the FAA, said it was unlikely that Alaska crews worked on the plug because the plane was only delivered to the airline in October.', 'That means the investigation will likely focus on manufacturing, assembly and quality control, Wallace said.', 'This could put more pressure on Boeing CEO David Calhoun, who was brought in to help the company get past the crisis created by the Max crashes.', 'During his tenure, Boeing has lost $23 billion and struggled with manufacturing flaws that have at times held up deliveries of 737s and larger Boeing 787s.', 'Calhoun called an all-employees meeting Tuesday, hosted at the companys 737 factory in Renton, Washington.', 'Were going to approach this, number one, acknowledging our mistake, Calhoun said, according to comments provided by Boeing.', 'Reporters were not allowed to attend.', 'The CEO said he trusts the NTSB to find the cause of the accident, and trusts the FAA to take all necessary steps to ensure every next airplane that moves into the sky is in fact safe, and that this event can never happen again.', 'No one was seriously hurt Friday aboard the affected Alaska jetliner, but Ed Pierson, a former senior manager at Boeings 737 factory, said the door plug issue is a wake-up call for Boeing and regulators to act before something worse happens.', 'Pierson, now the executive director of The Foundation for Aviation Safety, said Boeing assembly line workers are pressured to rush, and that the company has cut back on quality control inspections.', 'That, he said, can lead to mistakes.', 'The pressure is Move the plane down the line, Its not, Stop, lets fix it, lets do it right, he said.', 'Other former Boeing employees and outsiders who have examined the company say its safety culture degraded after a 1997 merger that left many McDonnell Douglas leaders in charge.', 'They rejected the Boeing culture, where the engineers had the final say on everything, in order to chase the stock price and their executive options, DeFazio said.', 'They need to go back to being what they were and could be, which is the greatest engineering aerospace company in the world.', 'Spirit AeroSystems record is also likely to come under more scrutiny.', 'In a federal securities lawsuit filed last May in Manhattan, an investor charged that Spirit concealed widespread quality failures including defects in fuselage fittings, improperly drilled holes in bulkheads that keep planes pressurized, and missing fasteners.', 'The lawsuit includes an unidentified manufacturing team leaders email that said a manager told workers to falsify reports on the number of defects found on planes.', 'The lawsuit was reported early Tuesday by The Lever, an investigative-journalism website.', 'Spirit declined Tuesday to comment on the lawsuit.', 'Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said the NTSB must determine whether additional inspection and maintenance should have been done before the aircraft carried passengers anywhere.', 'He asked new FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker what the regulatory agency is doing to protect air traveler safety.', 'A focus on how the door plugs were installed could be the best outcome for Boeing, said John Goglia, a former member of the NTSB.', 'He said a finding of sloppy installation work would eliminate the need for more costly, time consuming door plug redesign.', 'Installation errors happen all the time, said Goglia, who started his career as an aircraft mechanic.', 'Faulting the installation in Boeing planes impeaches their quality system, but it doesnt impeach their design.', 'Shares of The Boeing Co. fell 1% Tuesday, a day after they plunged 8%.', 'Spirit AeroSystems was nearly unchanged Tuesday but lost 11% Monday.', 'AP News Researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this

questioning the structural design of the section of the Boeing 737 Max 9 that blew off the plane.']","['In the aftermath of last weeks Alaska Airlines in-flight emergency, some aviation experts\xa0are\xa0questioning the structural design of\xa0the\xa0section of the\xa0Boeing 737 Max 9\xa0that blew off\xa0the plane.', 'On that January 5 flight, a door plug – a portion of the planes fuselage the manufacturer can put in place instead of an emergency exit door – detached from the plane and was later discovered in an Oregon backyard.', 'In interviews with CNN, some experts argued that if that door plug were designed to be larger than the opening it covers and installed inside the plane,\xa0the force of the pressurized air in the passenger cabin\xa0would force the plug against the planes interior frame and a\xa0situation\xa0such as the one on the Alaska Airlines flight could have been\xa0avoided.', 'However, such a design could have added costs and practical disadvantages, some said.', 'It doesnt make sense to me why they would do it that way and not have it installed from the inside, where it literally cannot come out unless there is a structural failure in the airframe,\xa0said David Soucie, a former FAA safety inspector and CNN analyst.', 'Historically, since we have had pressurized airplanes, emergency exits are designed to come inward… so why would they have not done the same thing with this plug?', 'Soucie said\xa0the design of the door plug on the Max 9\xa0may provide some advantages, such as making the plane more readily accessible for maintenance.', 'Robert Ditchey, an aviation consultant, agreed that if\xa0the plug\xa0were\xa0designed to be larger than the hole in the fuselage and installed inside the cabin, this incident\xa0likely\xa0would not have happened.', 'It should have been installed from the inside to the outside, not the other way around, Ditchey said of the plug, adding that the exterior installation raises the prospect that the bolts used to secure the plug could have failed.', 'You could have missing bolts, he said.', 'They could have had the wrong bolts, or they could have over-torqued the bolts thereby breaking them, or not torqued them enough.', 'John Goglia, a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board, said that while a different design could theoretically prevent a problem like this from happening, he described this design as adequate so long as proper installation and quality controls are followed.', 'Could you design a plug door for this airplane that would prevent it from going out, the answer is yes you could.', 'It just is going to cost you money and time, he said.', 'Was this design adequate is the real question, and if it was installed properly, we wouldnt be talking about it.', 'There really is not a big issue with having this door in there, if it was secured right, Goglia said.', 'A Boeing spokesperson declined to comment on the door-plug design, citing an active investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.', 'In a staff-wide meeting Tuesday, Boeings CEO attributed the incident to a mistake, which he did not identify.', 'A company source\xa0told\xa0CNN that Boeing believes the mistake in question was introduced in the aircrafts manufacturing supply chain.', 'Boeing CEO David Calhoun told CNBC in an interview that aired Wednesday that\xa0he is confident in the Federal Aviation Administrations ongoing work with airlines to inspect each and every one of the airplanes and make certain that theyre in conformance with our design, which is a proven design.', 'Federal investigators have determined the components that may have been involved in the door plug coming loose, but they have not yet determined why it blew out, CNN\xa0reported\xa0Monday.', 'The door plug is typically held in place by stop fittings and has a set of bolts that prevent the door from moving and potentially flying

analyst, said door plugs have long been used in aviation and, in addition to the Max 9, have been used on\xa0planes converted to freighters.', 'But she also questioned this particular design.', 'She said this door plug used on some Max 9s is designed not to be one of these wedge-doors, that when pressurized it cant be opened … its a door that has to be opened from the outside during some

probation from around 2018 to at least 2021.', 'The suit, which was previously reported by the publication The Lever, does not specifically mention door plugs.', 'The suit claims that constant quality failures resulted in part from Spirits culture which prioritized production numbers and short-term financial outcomes over product quality, and Spirits related failure to hire sufficient personnel to

supply chain.', 'For five years, Boeing has faced repeated quality and safety issues with its aircraft, leading to the long-term grounding of some jets and a halt in deliveries of others.', 'The 737 Maxs design was found to be responsible for two fatal crashes: one in Indonesia in October 2018, and the other in Ethiopia in March 2019.', 'Together, the\xa0two crashes killed all 346

grounding showed one employee describing the jet as designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.', 'Late last month, Boeing asked airlines to\xa0inspect all of their 737 Max jets\xa0for a potential loose bolt in the rudder system after an airline discovered a potential problem with a key part on two aircraft.', 'Its quality and engineering problems have extended beyond the 737.',

among its peers to report results for the holiday travel period.', 'Delta saw another strong quarter for travel demand, the company beating on the top and bottom line, posting $2 billion in Q4 profits, but the company did trim its 2024 earnings forecast.', 'I got a chance to speak to Delta Airlines CEO, Ed Bastian, about these results and what he expects to see in the year ahead.', 'ED BASTIAN: One of the things that I am most proud of when I look at our achievements in 2003, was the work our team did in providing an outstanding product for our customers.', 'We just finished the busiest holiday travel period in our history, with the 15-day period around Christmas New Years break.', 'As a result, we also closed the year out with revenues at an all time high, and 24 is off to a flying start as well.', 'BRAD SMITH: And when he talks about that flying start that 24 is off to here in this year, they actually just saw the highest cash sales day in its history, January 9th, so just earlier this week.', 'So that is adding to this optimistic outlook here.', 'But its a larger question of how long this can continue.', 'We were just talking about the CPI airfare prints that came out just yesterday, this week, and really evaluating what consumers are seeing in this even value-conscious environment that would propel them to continue to make some of these bookings, take those trips.', 'Is it as simple as, youve got a friend that didnt get married during 2020, they had to push it all the way out to 2024, and now youve just got to make sure you travel for their wedding.', 'SEANA SMITH: Yeah, I think the big question going into this year, especially when you compare it to the pent up demand that we had seen over the last two years, is whether or not any of that is going to carry into this year and of course to what degree.', 'So I think thats what a number of these airline CEOs are trying to figure out up until this point, were going to hear a little bit more when we get more results from the sector over the coming weeks.', 'But in terms of demand, no surprise that this past quarter was huge here for the company, when we talk about record travel over the Thanksgiving over the holiday period, the fact that people were still willing to spend, despite the fact that its a very uncertain environment.', 'So I think taking all of that into account, its an extremely optimistic set up here, at least on the demand side of things when you take out the costs and some of the pressures that were seeing from other factors, obviously, on airlines.', 'From the demand side of things, I think theres a lot to still be encouraged about at this point.', 'BRAD SMITH: Yeah, and people are taking a look at the screen here, and taking a look at the stock price reaction here this morning, perhaps wondering why shares are down 5%.', 'Lets add a little bit more color on that I had the chance of asking Ed Bastian how long he thinks this surge in travel demand and spending can persist.', 'Heres what he had to say.', 'ED BASTIAN: Travel is just catching up to its normal level of activity, and its been viewed to be revenge travel, and its really just people just returning to the skies, because the economy is larger, and the health of the industry is doing well.', 'So we ended the year, as I mentioned earlier, 20% above pre-pandemic levels, we expect this year to set another record.', 'So I think the return of international travel will be multi-year, the journey.', 'I dont think the price points will be as expensive as they were this past m but theyre still going to be at a very healthy level for us.', 'BRAD SMITH: And so with that in mind, one of the kind of normalization considerations here for investors is that one thing that has to be readjusted or recalibrated here is the expenses that are going into this operation.', 'You have a pilot negotiation that finally came to a conclusion last year.', 'You also had that capacity restoration effort, plus bringing on more aircraft.', 'Those aircraft they actually just made an announcement here today for Airbus, and that partnership thats going to continue to move forward, potentially going to add another cost component to this purchasing, 20 A350-1,000s with options for 20 additional wide body aircraft from Airbus, those are scheduled to begin in 2026.', 'And so he did give us a little bit more color on that, saying essentially that is one of the contributors to the cost inputs.', 'And I think, additionally here, youve got to think about the margin-- the growth deceleration here, the margin growth deceleration is something that investors might be also paying close attention to here, coming off of what was the revenge travel and the restoration of capacity, and everybody getting back to the air.', 'Well now its going to be tough comps that all the airline operators really have to think about too.', 'SEANA SMITH: It is going to be tough comps.', 'That was, obviously, evident in this forecast.', 'But I also thought its important to point out.', 'And he noted this in the release and in the conversation with you, just in terms of the fact that theyre still optimistic about some of their long-term profit targets here.', 'So the fact that they havent been able to reach that more than $7 a share, a target that theyve had for 2024, questions about whether or not theyre going to be able to do that.', 'Ed Bastian saying that with all the uncertainty in the environment, they thought that it was important for them to be prudent at this time.', 'But theyre not giving up on the $7 a share.', 'So theyre still optimistic that they are going to get there.', 'But, obviously, the cost pressures when it comes to wages, when it comes to higher fuel costs, taking that into account when it also comes to some of that CapEx spending clearly is going to weigh on results, at least, in the short term.', 'BRAD SMITH: Ill tell you one other thing theyre not giving up on.', 'Theyre not giving up on Boeing here.', 'Despite the fleet update that I just mentioned and the purchase of those A350-1000 from Airbus, theyre continuing to have confidence in Boeing.', 'And heres what he had to say about Boeing, when I had the opportunity to speak with Delta CEO Ed Bastian.', 'ED BASTIAN: We do not operate the Max currently as you know.', 'And we have no intent and plan to operate the Max-9 either.', 'Obviously, a concerning event.', 'Its one that we are not in a position to speculate, as to what happens.', 'I have full faith in Boeing.', 'Boeing is a great, great company.', 'BRAD SMITH: And so just a little bit more color, they do not operate the Max-9.', 'Delta Airlines does anticipate that Boeing will begin delivering a portion of its order though for 100 737 Max-10 aircraft to come in 2025 here.', 'So that is one thing to continue to watch within the relationship between both the airline operator and the aircraft manufacturer.', 'But there you heard it from Ed Bastian, still has confidence in them as a technology company, and, of course, one of the great American stories of aircraft ingenuity, as well.', 'And thats exactly what weve heard from a number of the strategists and analysts that weve been talking to over the last five days.', 'Obviously, the developments and the headlines that have been coming out from Boeing, it is concerning.', 'It is a short-term issue that needs to be addressed and addressed in a very timely manner.', 'But when you take into account and take a step back and what this means for the larger picture of Boeing in terms of that systemic risk, theres no real sign or any evidence right now that some of these airlines should be adjusting future orders or lose confidence in Boeing.', 'That was my main takeaway from many of the analysts that weve talked to over the last several days.', 'And it sounds like Ed Bastian also agrees with that to a certain degree and saying that he is confident just in terms of what Boeing is doing with its products in the company and what the future holds for them.', 'And theres just such a backlog, as we were speaking with some of those analysts earlier this week, too, of being able to work through some of the supply chain issues, take delivery of aircraft as well, and then replace those and move those into the cycle of routes that they already operate or routes that are coming online as well here.', 'Just lastly, and Ill close on this, he mentioned that the Boeing 737 Max-10 is anticipated to have an elevated customer experience, improve fuel efficiency as well.', 'And some of the best in class performance that they have come to expect from Boeing over the years and perhaps will move them forward and propel them to higher heights-- higher heights.', 'Everybody wants to go there.', 'Anyway, a big thanks to Delta CEO, Ed Bastian, for that interview.']",['Delta closed 2023 20 % pre-pandemic travel level : CEO'],"['Delta Air Lines (

Seattle fliers are switching their trips to Delta Air Lines as hometown carrier Alaska Airlines schedule takes a hit from the latest Boeing 737 Max grounding.', 'Delta President Glen Hauenstein said Friday that the carrier has seen a small uptick in bookings in Seattle since the Federal Aviation Administration grounded all 737 Max 9 planes with door plugs last Saturday.', 'Alaska operates 65 737-9s with door plugs and the grounding is forcing it to cancel between 110-150 flights per day.', 'United operates 79 of the 737-9s with door plugs.', 'However, Uniteds cancellations are a smaller percentage of its schedule – it has a 945 plane-strong mainline fleet compared to 230 for Alaska.', 'Its kind of minimal in the grander scheme of things, but its relevant in Seattle, Hauenstein told analysts on Deltas fourth-quarter earnings call.', 'Both Alaska and Delta have hubs in Seattle.', 'Delta reported an adjusted operating profit of $6.3 billion for 2023.', 'That translates to an operating margin of 11.6%.', 'Its adjusted net profit was $4 billion.', 'The boost Delta sees in Seattle comes amid still strong overall travel demand in the U.S. Executives described the market as exciting, and said they expect unit revenues — how much an airline earns per seat mile flown — to turn positive by the end of the first quarter.', 'The domestic U.S. has faced too much airline capacity since last summer, which has pushed airfares — and unit revenues — down in many markets.', 'Some airlines, including discounters Frontier and Spirit, as well as JetBlue even forecast 2023 losses.', 'Thats why Delta, and others, are focused on slowing growth to boost revenues in the market.', 'And the fact that Delta executives made no mention of weak or slowing travel demand indicates that the number of travelers is at least holding steady.', 'One very positive development: Travel volumes from large corporate customers, think Fortune 500 companies, has recovered to roughly 90% of pre-pandemic levels, Hauenstein said.', 'That gives Delta hope that it could see a full recovery in corporate travel volumes this year.', 'Delta unveiled a long-anticipated order for up to 40 Airbus A350-1000s on Friday.', 'The deal includes 20 firm aircraft with deliveries from 2026, plus 20 options it could exercise later.', 'More A350s for Delta was not a surprise.', 'The airline made the decision in 2020 to streamline its widebody fleet around Airbus planes — the A330neo and A350 — when it retired its Boeing 777 fleet.', 'And Boeings decision to kill its new mid-market airplane program in early 2022 meant the Virginia-based airframer was almost certainly out of the running to provide a Boeing 767 replacement to Delta.', 'Now we have clarity on Deltas widebody fleet plan.', 'A350-1000s will sit at the top with seating for nearly 400 passengers, followed by A350-900s, and A330-900s, -300s, and -200s.', 'We will see a cascade of new A350-1000s replacing smaller -900s on certain routes, which in turn will replace A330s that will eventually allow the retirement of its aging 767s.', 'Delta plans to pull 767-300ERs from long-haul routes by 2028, and retire the planes by 2030, Hauenstein said.', 'The larger — and newer — 767-400ERs will continue to fly into the 2030s.', 'One big question is whether the supply chain issues that continue to dog the industry will force adjustments in Deltas fleet plan.', 'Asked Friday whether he expected the situation to improve this year, CEO Ed Bastian said: I hope theres no more surprises, but Id be lying to you if I thought thats the case.', 'We had a fantastic year in the transatlantic, Hauenstein said of 2023.', 'Were hoping to beat that, but theres a really high bar as we move through the year.', 'Bookings to Europe through April are pretty exciting with unit revenues up high single digits, he said.', 'That is particularly encouraging given the first few months of the year is the slowest period for U.S.-Europe travel.', 'But, as Hauenstein noted, Delta faces a high bar to beat last years transatlantic performance this summer.', 'Airlines, after seeing the record numbers last year, have piled on with new flights this summer.', 'The additions come from major carriers like American Airlines and the Lufthansa Group, as well as discounters Norse Atlantic Airways and Play Airlines.', 'Airline capacity between the Europe and U.S. is scheduled to increase nearly 9% in for the three months beginning in June, according to Cirium Diio schedules.', 'Delta is less bullish on its Latin America and Pacific franchises this year.', 'While Hauenstein expects revenue growth in both regions, the airlines own expansion — and recovery — mean unit revenues are forecast to stay depressed well into 2024.', 'Delta posted a $1.3 billion adjusted operating profit and a 9.7% operating margin in the fourth quarter.', 'Revenues increased 12% to $12.2 billion compared to a year earlier.', 'Total unit revenues decreased 3% while unit costs excluding fuel increased 1%.', 'For the full year, revenues at Delta increased 15% to $58 billion.', 'Total unit revenues decreased 2% on a 2% increase in unit costs excluding fuel.', 'Delta forecasts 3-6% more revenue on roughly 6% more capacity in the first quarter.', 'It expects a roughly 5% operating margin in the period.', 'And, for the full year, it plans to increase capacity by 3-5%.', 'What am I looking at?', 'The performance of airline sector stocks within the\xa0ST200.', 'The index includes companies publicly traded across global markets including

in a memo to employees obtained by CNN that the company would be performing more inspections of each 737 before they are delivered.', 'He also said Boeing is now more closely monitoring the work of a key supplier that builds the 737 Max fuselage.', 'Last week, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said he was considering requiring an independent third party to oversee Boeings inspections and its quality system.', 'A week ago, Calhoun acknowledged the companys mistake at a staff-wide safety meeting, but he did not specify what that mistake was.', 'National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy has demanded Boeing provide answers about any mistake it made as part of its safety investigation, which is separate from the FAAs audit.', 'Although the investigation is ongoing, and it remains unclear what caused the door plug to blow off the plane, two airlines with a large number of 737 Max 9 planes in service — Alaska Airlines and United Airlines — said they found either loose hardware or bolts in the assembly of door plugs on their aircraft.', 'United says its discovery pointed to possible installation issues.', 'In a letter to Boeing last week, the FAA gave the company 10 days to supply any information on the cause of the Alaska Airlines incident.', 'It also wants to know what actions Boeing has taken to prevent it from happening again.', 'Wells Fargo analysts noted in their report that the FAA investigation could take some time to complete, noting many of its probes remain under investigation months after the original incidents.', 'All 737 Max 9 planes remain grounded as the FAA works to approve Boeings inspection criteria for airlines to assess the safety of the aircraft.', 'The regulator has not provided a timeline of when the planes might return to service.', 'Alaska and United have canceled more than 100 flights a day as they await an all-clear from the FAA.', 'Boeing has faced repeated quality and safety issues with its aircraft for five years now, leading to the long-term grounding of some jets and the halt in deliveries of others.', 'The 737 Maxs design was found to be responsible for two fatal crashes: one in Indonesia in October 2018 and the other in Ethiopia in March 2019.', 'Together, the\xa0two crashes killed all 346 people\xa0aboard the two flights and led to a\xa020-month grounding\xa0of the companys best-selling jets, which\xa0cost it more than $21 billion.', 'Internal communications released during the 737 Max grounding showed one employee describing the jet as designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.', 'What travelers need to know about the Boeing 737 Max 9 grounding Late last month, Boeing asked airlines to\xa0inspect all of their 737 Max jets\xa0for a potential loose bolt in the rudder system after an airline discovered a potential problem with a key part on two aircraft.', 'Its quality and engineering problems have extended beyond the 737.', 'Boeing also had to twice halt deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner, for\xa0about a year\xa0starting in 2021\xa0and again in 2023, due to quality concerns cited by the FAA.', 'And the\xa0777 jet\xa0also suffered a grounding after an engine failure on a United flight\xa0scattered engine debris\xa0onto homes and the ground below.', 'Two Max variants — the Max 7 and the Max 10 — are still awaiting approval to begin carrying passengers.', 'This latest incident complicates that, Wells Fargo analysts noted.', 'The Max 7 and Max 10 variants… are now likely to receive greater scrutiny, they said.', 'This includes a required

operators, according to a joint news release.', 'Interline agreements are a common way airlines use partner airlines to move shipments to destinations they dont service.', 'The tight regulatory

flexibility by utilizing the freighter and passenger belly space of the carriers.', 'CMA CGM took a 9% share in Air France-KLM when the deal was struck and will remain a shareholder.', 'But the lockup period on the subscribed shares has been adjusted to end in February 2025 and will not be partly extendable until 2028, as originally planned.', 'Under the exit agreement, CMA CGM will step down from

escalating in several hotspots worldwide, as illustrated by the ongoing clashes in the Red Sea.', 'Furthermore, the aerospace and defense sector is attractive because these are excellent businesses that enjoy significant strategic moats.', 'They have longstanding relationships with their customers (governments), and this industry features significant regulatory barriers to entry.', 'Furthermore, building these types of products requires substantial technological expertise and investment in RD.', 'Because of these factors, it is difficult for newcomers to disrupt these companies.', 'With this in mind, which is the best defense ETF?', 'According to BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the iShares U.S. Aerospace  Defense ETF seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of U.S. equities in the aerospace and defense sector.', 'The fund invests in U.S. companies that manufacture commercial and military aircraft and other defense equipment.', 'ITA has been around since 2006, and it is the largest aerospace and defense ETF with $5.9 billion in assets under management.', 'ITA has provided investors with solid returns over the years.', 'As of December 31, 2023, the fund has generated an annualized three-year return of 11.2%, an annualized five-year return of 9.2%, and an annualized 10-year return of 10.3%.', 'The fund owns 36 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 76.15% of assets.', 'Below is an overview of ITAs top 10 holdings using TipRanks holdings tool.', 'As you can see, its very concentrated in its top holdings, like Raytheon (NYSE:RTX) and Boeing (NYSE:BA), which have massive weightings of 17.6% and 16.6%, respectively.', 'Overall, this has been a good ETF over the years, but this outsized position in Boeing may be cause for concern at this point, as the aircraft manufacturer has become embroiled in a number of mishaps early in 2024.', 'These include the highly-publicized incident in which the door plug came off of a Boeing 737 midflight, causing an emergency landing, and a collision involving two Boeing airplanes at Chicagos OHare airport.', 'Boeing clearly faces significant questions going forward, and the issues led several sell-side analysts to downgrade the stock.', 'ITA gives investors a lot of exposure to the troubled stock, which is cause for concern.', 'Turning to Wall Street, ITA earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 27 Buys, nine Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months.', 'The average ITA stock price target of $134.24 implies 10.75% upside potential.', 'Lastly, ITA features an expense ratio of 0.40%, meaning that an investor in the fund will pay $40 on a $10,000 investment annually.', 'ITA has been a strong performer over the years, but its large position in Boeing could be a headwind in the short-to-intermediate term.', 'This brings us to the SPDR SP Aerospace  Defense ETF.', 'State Streets XAR launched in 2011 and has $1.9 billion in assets under management.', 'According to fund sponsor State Street, XAR seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, generally correspond to the total return performance of the SP Aerospace  Defense Select Industry Index.', 'This is a modified equal-weighted index which provides the potential for unconcentrated industry exposure across large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks.', 'This modified equal-weighted approach is appealing because it means that, unlike ITA, XAR doesnt have massive exposure to Boeing.', 'While Boeing makes up 16.6% of ITA, XAR has a more manageable 3.5% weighting towards Boeing.', 'In fact, it isnt even one of XARs top 10 positions.', 'In total, XAR owns 35 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 41.6% of the fund, so it is far less concentrated than ITA.', 'Below is an overview of XARs top 10 holdings using TipRanks holdings tool.', 'As you can see, XAR is more diversified than ITA, as its top holdings like Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON), L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX), and Raytheon (NYSE:RTX) each have weightings of just 4.2%.', 'As of December 31, 2023, XAR generated a fairly underwhelming three-year annualized return of 6.3% but much more impressive five- and 10-year annualized returns of 12.2% and 11.7%, respectively.', 'This three-year return was worse than ITAs, but its five- and 10-year returns were slightly better.', 'Like ITA, XAR earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buys, 10 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months.', 'The average XAR stock price target of $148.13 implies 14.75% upside potential.', 'Finally, XARs expense ratio of 0.35% is the cheapest of the group.', 'Im constructive on XAR, given its strong long-term five- and 10-year performance, its lower exposure to Boeing, and the fact that it has the most cost-effective expense ratio of these three major defense ETFs.', 'Invescos PPA launched in 2005 and has $2.6 billion in AUM.', 'According to Invesco (NYSE:IVZ), PPA invests at least 90% of its assets in the SPADE Defense Index, an index that is comprised of the stocks of companies that are involved in the development, manufacturing, operations and support of US defense, homeland security and aerospace operations.', 'PPA has outperformed both ITA and XAR in recent years.', 'As of December 31, the fund has an annualized three-year return of 12.1%, an annualized five-year return of 14.8%, and an annualized 10-year return of 13.3%.', 'PPA holds 52 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 52.2% of assets.', 'Below is an overview of PPAs top 10 holdings using TipRanks holdings tool.', 'As you can see, like XAR, PPA has a more manageable position in Boeing (accounting for 5.05% of the fund).', 'On the downside, PPA is the most expensive of these three funds, with an expense ratio of 0.58%.', 'PPA earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 40 Buys, 12 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months.', 'The average PPA stock price target of $99.14 implies 9.7% upside potential.', 'In conclusion, Im optimistic about all three of these ETFs as the aerospace and defense sector looks well-positioned for the short term based on escalating tensions worldwide and for the long term based on the strong moats these businesses enjoy.', 'All three are good ETFs, and they all invest in similar businesses.', 'One key difference is that ITA is much more exposed to Boeing than the other two ETFs discussed here.', 'Given the considerable issues that Boeing is dealing with right now, this could be a detriment to ITA, going forward.', 'Based on that, I am ranking XAR and PPA ahead of ITA at this point in time.', 'PPA and XAR have a lot in common, and both feature lower exposure to Boeing.', 'PPA has generated slightly better returns, but I view XAR as the best

to aircraft trader Jetran, which is bullish on the aircrafts prospects.', 'The post Jetran buys Cargojet rights for 777 freighter conversions appeared first on FreightWaves.']","['Aircraft dealer Jetran LLC has acquired the rights to four Boeing 777-200 converted freighters from Cargojet, which this week dropped plans to buy the long-haul aircraft along with a modification package for main-deck cargo transport, FreightWaves has learned.', 'Cargojet on Monday said it was backing out of commitments with Mammoth Freighters, a startup aerospace firm backed by Fortress Investment Group that has designed an airframe conversion kit for 777 passenger aircraft, because of soft international demand for airfreight.', 'Instead, it will focus on maximizing utilization of existing Boeing 757 narrowbody and 767 medium freighters in its Canada overnight express network and on international charter routes.', 'The airline had previously telegraphed that two of the large freighters would be operated for DHL Express, but co-CEO James Porteous on Thursday said Cargojet changed its mind when it couldnt get firm commitments for the other two units and realized economies of scale werent possible with such a small fleet.', 'Cargojet originally envisioned having eight 777s, but last year it decided not to move forward with an investment in four 777-300s — eventually selling them and canceling production slots at an Israeli retrofit company.', 'Porteous said the -300s were speculative investments that didnt pan out with express operators or other cargo airlines once demand began contracting in 2022 from record highs fueled by the pandemics disruption of supply chains.', 'Spreading the fixed cost of hiring crews, pilot training, flight simulator time, spare parts and maintenance infrastructure across several revenue aircraft is much more efficient with a larger fleet, according to aviation experts, and Cargojet realized that even four aircraft were too few to justify the upfront expenditures.', 'It had budgeted $1.2 billion to launch the 777 program.', 'When we looked at the cost of capital as a public company — everything from ramping up the number of pilots [and maintenance staff] we would need to hire to cover the first two aircraft and routes for DHL, plus all the spare parts and tooling, and wed have to buy or build a hangar at our hub in Hamilton [Ontario] because the aircraft doesnt fit in our existing hangars — we just finally came to the conclusion this doesnt make economic sense.', 'Its not a great use of capital, Porteous said in a phone interview from an investor conference in Whistler, British Columbia.', 'Cargojet netted $75 million to $82 million from buying and selling the 777-200s, according to Mondays announcement.', 'Porteous declined to identify who bought the 777-200s and a flight simulator, but Jetran confirmed it is the buyer.', 'Jetran basically decided to step into Cargojets commitments to take those four airplanes because we see tremendous value in the [777 passenger-to-freighter] program and that asset class, CEO Jordan Jaffe said in an interview.', 'He declined to say how much Jetran paid for the aircraft or who the end user will be.', 'Mammoth Freighters, which is working to validate its design and get it certified by the Federal Aviation Administration for use in commercial aircraft, has 35 confirmed orders.', 'Jetran has more than 20 of them, including nine 777-200s that will be resold to DHL Express.', 'Mammoth has a large maintenance hangar in Fort Worth, Texas, where conversion kits are being installed using Mammoths design, as well as a licensed contractor in the United Kingdom.', 'It will also offer conversions for the 777-300.', 'Assembly work involves gutting the planes interior, adding a rigid barrier to protect the cockpit, installing a large door for pallets and reinforcing the floor to support heavy loads.', 'The process typically takes four to five months for a large airliner, but prototype aircraft used for validation flights and certification take longer to complete.', 'The downturn in the air cargo market since the spring of 2022 has chilled orders for factory-built and converted freighters, raising concerns of a potential glut in narrowbody freighters as prior orders continue to be fulfilled.', 'Analysts say there still is a need for more widebody capacity with Boeing last year ending production of the 747 jumbo jet, Western sanctions against Russia for invading Ukraine effectively removing many extra-large freighters from the market, airlines retiring MD-10 and MD-11 freighters, and other aircraft starting to reach the end of their useful life.', 'Jaffe said Cargojets decision doesnt reflect on its sales forecast or confidence in Mammoth Freighters.', 'Theyre extremely well capitalized.', 'They have an A-team of industry experts and some of the best facilities weve ever seen, he said.', 'Jetran, based in Horseshoe Bay, Texas, last year acquired five 747-400 freighters, which are more than 20 years old, from Taiwan-based China Airlines in a sale-leaseback as a gateway platform for new 777 converted freighters or next-generation 777s to be built by Boeing, said Jaffe.', 'The jumbo freighters, he explained, allow Jetran to pursue new customers that can eventually move into the 777 and provide a bridge for existing customers that need aircraft until the Mammoth conversions are available.', 'Airlines can take a short-term lease of three or four years and then transition to the 777 converted freighters.', 'I dont mind using the 747 as essentially a stopgap airplane, Jaffe said.', 'The 777s are heavy-lift aircraft that can carry more than 100 tons.', 'The wide fuselage makes them well suited for dense freight and light e-commerce shipments.', 'Mammoths 777-300 converted freighter is designed with 14% more volume than a 747-400 and is ideal for lightweight freight that takes up space because it has more interior volume but a similar weight payload to the 777-200.', 'That translates into 10 more main-deck pallet positions than the -200LR.', 'The 777-300 is ideal for medium-length routes of about eight hours.', 'The 777-200 is aimed more at long, intracontinental routes.', 'Both variants are twin-engine aircraft and much cheaper to operate than four-engine 747s.', 'Cargojet is focusing on its existing fleet of 41 freighters — 17 Boeing 757 narrowbody aircraft and 24 Boeing 767 medium widebodies.', 'The commonality of the flight deck with one pilot for both aircraft types, commonality of parts, makes a lot more sense for us to continue, especially in the domestic Canada market, Porteus told FreightWaves.', 'We feel we can continue to grow the ACMI [dedicated contract transport] business with DHL with the 17 or 18 aircraft that we have operating with them today.', 'Porteus acknowledged that Cargojet likely wont be able to sell four Boeing 757s recently identified as surplus because the industry has an oversupply of standard-size cargo jets.', 'He said Cargojet may be able to lease two aircraft and will return the others to service when parcel and freight demand pick up again.',

remain grounded through the end of this months and said the company will report a first quarter loss as a result.'],"['United Airlines, one of the biggest buyers of Boeing jets, is losing patience with the troubled aircraft maker.', 'Im disappointed that… this keeps happening at Boeing.', 'This isnt new, said Scott Kirby, CEO of United, in an interview Tuesday on CNBC.', 'We need Boeing to succeed.', 'But theyve been having these consistent manufacturing challenges.', 'They need to take action here.', 'Kirby made his comments after the airline warned investors that it will report a larger-than-expected loss in the first three months of this year because of the grounding of all 737 Max 9 jets after a door plug blew off on an Alaska Air flight on January 5, leaving a massive hole in the side of the plane.', 'The plane landed without any serious injuries, but the Federal Aviation Administration ordered the grounding and additional inspections of the more than 200 jets of that model worldwide.', 'United Airlines said it now expects its fleet of Boeing Max 9 jets to remain grounded through the end of this month, and that the company will report a first quarter loss in the range of $116 million to $262 million.', 'Thats more than the $138 million loss already forecast by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.', 'United has 79 of the Max 9s, more than any other airline, and had originally scheduled nearly 8,000 flights with the plane for this month before the incident, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm.', 'Beyond the current 737 Max 9 problem is what this means for Boeings orders for the 737 Max 10, a newer, larger version and more expensive version of the 737 Max that has yet to be certified by the FAA.', 'It will be at least five years in a best case scenario before Boeing can delivery those Max 10 jets to United, Kirby said, and the airline is now no longer counting on getting that plane in the future.', 'I think the Max 9 grounding is probably the straw that broke the camels back for us, said Kirby.', 'Were going to build a plan that doesnt have the Max 10 in it.', 'United has firm orders for 277 of the 737 Max 10, and options to buy an additional 200, and so if the airline were to pull out of those orders, it would be a massive blow for Boeings efforts to bring that plane to market.', 'And in a call with investors later in the day, Kirby said that the airline is not quite canceling the orders that it has for the Max 10, but it doesnt anticipate itll be receiving the jets, either.', 'We are taking it out of our internal plans, said Kirby.', 'And well be working on what that means exactly with Boeing.', 'But Boeing is not going to be able to meet their contractual deliveries on at least many of those airplanes.', 'And lets leave it at that.', 'United has orders for more than 500 Boeing jets in total on the books, more than twice as many as it does for jets from its rival Airbus.', 'But in the last six months, United took delivery of its first A321neo, a model that directly competes with the Boeing 737 Max.', 'But thanks to a deep order backlog at both companies, even if United were to drop its 737 Max 10 purchase plans, it would probably be forced to buy other 737 Max models rather than getting at the end of the line for buyers of Airbus jets.', 'That will constrain the company for quite some time, Kirby added.', 'Were still going to be the fastest growing airline, Kirby said.', 'But were not going to be as fast growing as we planned.', 'Boeing would not comment directly on Uniteds comments on its orders, other than to once again apologize for the problems that led to the incident at Alaska Air and the subsequent 737 Max 9 grounding.', 'We have let down our airline customers and are deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers, said Stan Deal, head of Boeings commercial aircraft unit, in a statement released by the company.', 'We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to bring these airplanes safely back to service and to improve our quality and delivery performance.', 'We will follow the lead of the FAA and support our customers every step of the way.', 'A terrifying 10 minute flight adds to years of Boeings quality control problems Boeing has had a series of quality issues that have dogged the aircraft maker for the last five years, ever since two fatal crashes of the 737 Max 8 in late 2018 and early 2019 led to a 20-month grounding of the jet.', 'United believes it is getting close to the completion of the inspections it needs to get approval to fly the 737 Max 9 once again, Kirby said.', 'I have a lot of confidence in the safety of these airplanes, particularly since we know what happened with this Max 9, he said.', 'I think were near the end game of getting that [model] back flying.', 'United did say it expects full year earnings of between $9 to $11 a share, a range which would include the current estimates of full-year earnings of $9.45 a share according to analysts, as well as 2023 earnings of $10.05 a share that it reported Monday.', 'And it reported fourth-quarter earnings of $2.00 a share,

(SAVE), Alaska Airlines (ALK) — and whether a manufacturer like Airbus (AIR.PA) could fill Boeings role for now.', 'Boeings dance card is filled until 2030... this is why we saw JetBlue trying to buy

none available.', 'So Airbus cant pick it up, thats the end of the game.', '- And Mike, the other big news for the industry, obviously were talking a lot about is this federal judge blocking JetBlue from merging with Spirit.', 'Is that, how does that impact the big US airlines, Mike?', 'Is that, is that actually good news, good news, no big rival to really threaten their dominance?', 'MIKE BOYD: Well, it really wasnt a merger where two root systems are being taken over.', 'It really was an asset buy as I just said.', 'JetBlue wanted the airplanes and the crews to use to expand.', 'My take on it, it would have improved competition in America.', 'Because JetBlue is an impulse carrier.', 'People see a low fare they go to Florida.', 'Spirit is an impulse carrier.', 'JetBlue is a mainline carrier that could have competed a whole lot better with those immediate 200 airplanes with United, Southwest, and Delta, and American.', '- And Mike, Ill get you out of here on this.', 'So weve heard from United at least initial reaction here in the after hours, investors seem to like what they heard.', 'Weve got other airlines though on deck, Mike, American, Alaska, JetBlue.', 'Do you expect generally good results from those?', 'I mean, at least the going forward picture for Alaska, theyre being pilloried by this.', 'Almost one third of their fleet is now grounded not flying.', 'That means about 30%, 35% of their seats arent being sold.', 'And JetBlue is having issues too.', 'Look, we do have problems at the periphery.', 'And what we see here is, its not going to be a 5% growth as we thought it was going to be, we think more like three in this year.', 'And theyre adjusting to it.', 'So I dont see good news happening only because of the Boeing thing at Alaska, and JetBlue has to restructure now because theyre not going to get those expansion airplanes they could have gotten and improved competition in America with that merger.']",['Boeing headwind mean airline

the Bell newsletter.', 'You can sign up\xa0right here.', 'You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.', 'The glass is half full on Wall Street.', 'Theres plenty for investors to celebrate right now, but a look under the hood reveals quite a bit of decay.', 'Here at Before the Bell were playing the role of Debbie Downer to Wall Streets Pollyanna and breaking down some of the arguments for a continued market rally.', 'Markets are hot: Theres been an optimistic narrative in markets these past few weeks.', 'The SP 500 just hit a new high for the first time in two years and the Dow crossed the 38,000 level on Monday for the first time ever.', 'In Europe, Germanys DAX traded at an all-time high Wednesday, and the STOXX index is closing in on a new record.', 'Real bond yields (thats the return on US Treasuries minus inflation) are near six-month lows.', 'And financial conditions are easing as borrowing costs decline, which may help economic growth.', 'But Wall Streets gains are narrow: Major indexes are up, but the broad market isnt.', 'As of last week, Nvidia and Microsoft accounted for about 75% of the SP 500s gain this year, according to analysts at Bespoke Investment Group.', 'The 20 largest stocks in the index, they found, made up 110% of the indexs gains, while the remaining 480 were acting as a drag.', 'Last year, the SP 500 rose by just over 24%, but if you were to weigh each stock in the index equally, it gained just 11.6%.', 'Thats the largest outperformance by the SP 500 over its equal-weighted version since the 1998 dot-com bubble, said Henry Allen, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, in a note to clients on Tuesday.', 'A narrow rally doesnt necessarily mean a crash is coming.', 'But its largely Big Tech thats driving markets higher, and that concentration of gains in so few stocks carries inherent risk.', 'Those equity gains could prove vulnerable to a change in sentiment towards that group, wrote Allen.', 'The economy is strong: Economic data has been doggedly resilient over the past few months.', 'The US unemployment rate is at 3.7% — the Federal Reserve predicted about a year ago that it would be at 4.6% right now.', 'Consumer sentiment in January reached its highest level since July 2021, according to the University of Michigans consumer sentiment index, and retail sales were up 0.6% in December.', 'Economists polled by the National Association of Business Economics now overwhelmingly say that the US economy will avoid a recession this year.', 'On top of that, inflation rates have been broadly easing, and Americans expect that to continue.', 'The University of Michigan found that consumers expect inflation to fall to 2.9% by next year, the lowest since December 2020.', 'But investors are adjusting expectations: Investors eventually get used to strong data, and come to expect it.', 'Any signal of a weakening economy could send stocks plunging.', 'Its hard for data to keep surprising in the same direction, since investors simply adjust their expectations, said Allen.', 'Rate cuts are likely: Fed officials are expecting and openly discussing interest rate cuts this year.', 'Fed Governor Christopher Waller said just last week that as long as inflation doesnt rebound and stay elevated, I believe the [Fed] will be able to lower the target range for the federal funds rate this year.', 'Financial markets currently see a nearly 46% chance the Fed will cut rates by March and about an 85% chance that the Fed will cut rates by May, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.', 'But Wall Street could be getting ahead of itself: Since the start of the year, investors have pushed back their rate cut timelines, said Allen.', 'Just one month ago, more than 75% of investors thought the central bank would cut rates at their March meeting.', 'Thats partially because a strong economy and geopolitical strife could speed up inflation, which could force the Fed to perform an about-face soon after starting to cut rates.', 'AI might save us: The boom in artificial intelligence has been a main driver of the recent rally in equities.', 'And the budding industry could increase productivity in the years to come.', 'In the next few years, the main impact of AI on work will be to help people do their jobs more efficiently.', 'That will be true whether they work in a factory or in an office, Microsoft founder Bill Gates wrote in a blog post last year.', 'AI has huge potential to increase productivity, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said at his firms last investor day.', 'It may be the technology that can bring down inflation.', 'But it could kill jobs: But the tech sector kicked off the new year with a spate of fresh job cuts that are coming at the same time as the industry is doubling down on investments into artificial intelligence.', 'The continued labor upheaval unfolding in the very industry creating AI may be an omen as the technology reshapes the broader business landscape in the years ahead.', 'United Airlines, one of the\xa0biggest buyers of Boeing jets, is losing patience with the troubled aircraft maker over its repeated quality problems, reports my colleague Chris Isidore.', 'Im disappointed that… this keeps happening at Boeing.', 'This isnt new, said Scott Kirby, CEO of United, in an interview Tuesday on CNBC.', 'We need Boeing to succeed.', 'But theyve been having these consistent manufacturing challenges.', 'They need to take action here.', 'Kirby made his comments after the airline warned investors that it will report a larger-than-expected loss in the first three months of this year because of the\xa0grounding of all 737 Max 9\xa0jets after\xa0a door plug blew off\xa0on an Alaska Airlines flight on January 5, leaving a massive hole in the side of the plane.', 'The plane landed without any serious injuries, but the Federal Aviation Administration ordered the grounding and additional inspections of more than 200 jets of that model worldwide.', 'United Airlines said it now expects its fleet of Boeing Max 9 jets to remain grounded through the end of this month, and that the company will report a first-quarter loss in the range of $116 million to $262 million.', 'Thats more than the $138 million loss already forecast by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.', 'Beyond the current 737 Max 9 problem is what this means for Boeings orders for the 737 Max 10, a newer, larger and more expensive version of the 737 Max that has yet to be certified by the FAA.', 'It will be at least five years in a best case scenario before Boeing can deliver those Max 10 jets to United, Kirby said, and the airline is now no longer counting on getting that plane in the future.', 'I think the Max 9 grounding is probably the straw that broke the camels back for us, said Kirby.', 'Were going to build a plan that doesnt have the Max 10 in it.', 'Shares of Boeing sank 1.6% on Tuesday.', 'Shares of United gained 5.3%.', 'Netflix announced a major boost in sign-ups in the fourth quarter on Tuesday.', 'The company added more than 13 million subscribers for the quarter, compared to Wall Streets expectation of 8.7 million, reports my colleague Samantha Delouya.', 'Netflixs stock jumped nearly 10% in pre-market trading Wednesday.', 'In the past year, the company implemented a number of initiatives aimed at adding subscribers, including a password-sharing crackdown that pushed password borrowers into creating their own subscriptions and the introduction of a lower-priced advertising-supported subscription tier for $6.99.', 'Earlier this month, Amy Reinhard, Netflixs president of advertising, said Netflixs ad tier hit more than 23 million monthly memberships.', 'In a letter to shareholders Tuesday, Netflix declared its password sharing crackdown a success.', 'We believe weve successfully addressed account sharing, ensuring that when people enjoy Netflix they pay for the service too, it

Alaska Airlines and United Airlines, which had been forced to cancel thousands of flights and aim to begin returning the planes to service on Friday and Sunday, respectively.', 'But the FAA decision to keep Boeing from expanding production will have wide-ranging effects across the industry.', 'Boeing is seeking to increase production of its single-aisle 737 MAX family to keep pace with demand and close a gap in the jet market with European planemaker Airbus.', 'Analysts have expressed concerns that extra scrutiny of Boeing factories following the MAX 9 door plug blowout would temper production increases for the smaller and more widely sold MAX 8, a key source of cash for Boeing and many suppliers.', 'We will not agree to any request from Boeing for an expansion in production or approve additional production lines for the 737 MAX until we are satisfied that the quality control issues uncovered during this process are resolved, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said.', 'The quality assurance issues we have seen are unacceptable.', 'Clarifying the order, the FAA subsequently told Reuters: That means Boeing can continue producing at the current monthly rate, but they cannot increase that rate.', 'Boeing said it would continue to cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA and follow the agencys direction as it took action to strengthen safety and quality.', 'The FAA offered no estimate of how long the limitation would last and did not specify the number of planes Boeing can produce each month.', 'In October, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said it planned to reach production of 38 MAX planes per month by the end of 2023.', 'Boeings latest 737 master schedule, which sets the production pace for suppliers, calls for production to rise to 42 jets per month in February, 47.2 in August, 52.5 by February 2025 and 57.7 in October 2025, Reuters reported in December.', 'However, Boeings own production pace can lag the supplier master schedule.', 'The FAAs decision could impact plans to stand up a new 737 MAX line in Everett, Washington, by mid-year 2024, following the end of production of Boeings iconic 747 in the massive plant.', 'The line, set to be the fourth 737 line overall and the first outside Renton, is needed to meet strong demand.', 'Boeing declined to comment on any potential impact on the Everett line.', 'Once accused of being too soft on Boeing, the FAA has toughened oversight since earlier MAX crashes led to a worldwide grounding, but Wednesdays intervention opens new territory, experts said.', 'Jefferies analysts said the FAA halt to expansion seemed restrictive and lacked a definitive timeline.', 'These actions (are) likely put pressure on any near-term production ramp, but appear to be more timing related, they added.', 'Some airlines could be significantly impacted by any freeze on higher production, a senior industry source said, though many in the industry have already factored in some delays as aerospace firms continue to recover from the pandemic.', 'United, for example, has 100 MAX deliveries scheduled for this year, according to a regulatory filing in October.', 'Boeing shares fell 2% in after-hours trading on Wednesday.', 'CHINA MAX DELIVERIES RESUME The FAA announcement came hours after Boeing delivered its first 737 MAX to a Chinese airline since March 2019, ending an almost five-year freeze and granting a respite for strained trade relations between the worlds two largest economies.', 'Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun faced questions from senators on the Alaska Airlines incident in a series of meetings on Wednesday on Capitol Hill.', 'Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell said she would hold hearings to investigate the root cause of Boeings safety lapses.', 'The American flying public and Boeing line workers deserve a culture of leadership at Boeing that puts safety ahead of profits, Cantwell said.', 'Calhoun said Boeing would restore public confidence in its airplanes.', 'We dont put planes in the air that we dont have 100% confidence in, Calhoun told reporters.', 'The China delivery is a boost during a difficult period for Boeing following the mid-air cabin blowout during a nearly full flight.', 'No one was killed in the incident, but regulators and industry insiders are applying new scrutiny to the planemakers manufacturing and quality control processes as a result.', 'China is one of the fastest-growing aerospace markets, which the company projects will account for 20% of the worlds aircraft demand through 2042.', 'It was China that first grounded MAX jets after a pair of crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed nearly 350 people.', 'While safety bans have been lifted with existing MAX jets flying inside China, new deliveries had remained on hold.', 'A 737 MAX 8 registered to China Southern Airlines left Seattle Boeing field in Washington state at 11:55 a.m. Pacific Time (1955 GMT) on Wednesday and landed in Honolulu almost seven hours later, flight

revolt at the board of directors level if the stock keeps dropping, and if the future of the company looks dim.', 'Right now, as I said, United is really ticked at them.', 'And United has the horsepower to maybe go to Airbus.', 'They only have about 200 Airbuses on order.', 'But when you have 700 Maxs on order of different types, they got power.', 'And I think they may walk away.', 'To some degree, they may walk.', 'BRAD SMITH: Mike, just lastly while we have you, you mentioned those earnings that we saw come out from Southwest.', 'And weve been monitoring the reaction in shares of LUV here this morning, at least as of right now on the Yahoo Finance platform with about 10 minutes to go until the start of trade.', 'Looks like theyre holding on to some gains here.', 'Anything that jumps out to you from that report about the consumer or some of the other labor negotiations that they are moving through and towards as well in the flight attendants case?', 'MIKE BOYD: Well, what you hit on the head here, the new pilot contract at SWAPA is going to be 50% by the end of the-- by the time it comes amendable again.', 'Flight attendants could be looking for the same thing.', 'So we havent really worked that into that because thats going to change where Southwest can fly, how they can fly, what their economics are to places like Hawaii, and things like that.', 'So theyre going to address that.', 'And I dont think thats been looked at hard enough by the folks on Wall Street yet.', 'BRAD SMITH: Are they able to still be a profitable low cost carrier with some of the new

Airlines plane earlier this month will cost the airline about $150 million, Alaska announced Thursday.']","['The grounding of the 737 Max 9 after a January 5 incident that blew a hole in the side of an Alaska Airlines plane earlier this month will cost the airline about $150 million, Alaska announced Thursday.', 'The loss is significant to an airline the size of Alaska, which reported on Thursday an adjusted income of $38 million in the final three months of the year and $583 million for the full year.', 'The fourth quarter income was better than forecast for Alaska.', 'The door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines flight on January 5, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane.', 'While no passengers were killed, the incident led the Federal Aviation Administration to order a grounding of all 737 Max 9 jets.', 'With 65 of the planes Alaska has the second most 737 Max 9 jets in its fleet, behind only United, which has also warned it expects a first quarter loss at least partly due to the cost of the grounding.', 'On Wednesday, the FAA spelled out inspection procedures to return the planes to flight.', 'Alaska Air said the first of its grounded jets will be back in service on Friday with more planes added every day as reviews are completed and each aircraft is deemed airworthy.', 'FAA approves a path for Boeing 737 Max 9s to return to operations We expect inspections on all our 737-9 Max to be completed over the next week, it said.', 'The cost to Alaska Air is primarily from lost revenue, as the cost to compensate customers for hotels when their flights are canceled and overtime for staff will be balanced by the fuel savings achieved by flying 3,000 fewer flights.', 'Alaska could ultimately pass the cost onto Boeing, as CFO Shane Tackett told investors Thursday that we fully expect to be made whole for the profit impact of the grounding.', 'But he said there are no details of that compensation as of yet.', 'The airline also expects that most passengers will be willing to return to the 737 Max 9 once it starts flying again.', 'I think at first, people will have some questions, some anxiety just like they did two years ago, Alaska CEO Ben Minicucci said, referring to when all models of the Max were approved to fly again following a 20-month grounding precipitated by two fatal crashes.', 'But I believe over time, the confidence will get back into this airplane.', 'The airline said Thursday that even if the planes return to service as planned, it will have had to cancel about 3,000 flights this month due to the grounding reducing its overall capacity by about 7% for the quarter as a whole.', 'Minicucci told NBC in an interview Tuesday that the carrier found some loose bolts on many Boeing 737 Max 9 during its inspections.', 'But when asked during an investors call Thursday if he was reconsidering the airlines decision to buy only Boeing aircraft going forward, he would not back off those plans.', 'We have a\xa0long-standing deep relationship with Boeing.', 'But\xa0like I said, its not acceptable what happened.', 'Were going to hold them accountable, and were going\xa0to raise the bar on quality on Boeing, he said.', 'We got 231 737s that\xa0weve been happy with.', 'And until the incident, we were happy with the Max.', 'We have 185 on order that are coming\xa0to us.', 'We believe with the network configuration we … have,\xa0the Boeing\xa0airplane is 737 is well suited for our network.', 'So that is\xa0the long-term plan, but were going to hold Boeings feet to\xa0the fire to make sure that we\xa0get good airplanes out of that\xa0factory.', 'Even with the $150 million hit from the grounding,  Alaska said it still expects to report a full-year 2024 profit of about $381 million to $635 million, but that guidance suggests it could fall short of estimates of $583 million, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.', 'Analysts are forecasting a loss of $79 million in the first quarter.', 'Alaska and United are the only US airlines with the 737 Max 9 jet in their fleets.', 'But it doesnt mean theyre the only affected by the problems at Boeing.', 'Southwest Airlines said Thursday that it now expects fewer 737 Max deliveries from Boeing this year than it had booked because one of the models it orders, the 737 Max 7, has yet to be certified by the FAA.', 'Its order book calls for the delivery of 27 of the Max 7 this year, along with 53 of the Max 8, but the airline said that should no longer be relied upon.', 'The FAA will ultimately determine the timing of the [737 Max] 7 certification and entry into service, and the company therefore offers no assurances that current estimations and timelines are correct, it said.', 'Southwest CEO Bob Jordan said the airline is no longer counting on any of the 737 Max 7 planes being delivered in 2024 but that it will be ready to change which planes it gets from Boeing.', 'If we dont get the Max 7, well take a Max 8, he said in an interview on CNBC.', 'He said its not clear what the FAA decision announced Wednesday to limit the growth of 737 Max production going forward will have on its deliveries.', 'As always, if theres an adjustment, well adjust, he said.', 'Again, I support that [limitation].', 'Anything that helps Boeing improve quality, address the issues, is good for Boeing, and it is good for Southwest Airlines.', 'American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said he doesnt expect a delay in the deliveries of the planes it is due to get from Boeing this year.', 'But he also had criticism of the aircraft maker.', 'We need them to produce a quality product every time.', 'We need everyone at Boeing getting their act together.', 'Its just essential, he said in an interview on CNBC.', 'We dont need the distraction.', 'Southwest does not have any 737 Max 9 jets, the one that was grounded this month, nor orders to buy any.', 'But it does have more than 200 of the 737 Max 8, making up about a quarter of its fleet.', 'CEO Bob Jordan said his airline, which flies nothing but Boeing 737s, said he doesnt believe that passengers will be reluctant to book on his airline due to its use of Boeing and 737 Max jets.', 'Our customers want confidence in our product.', 'They have a lot of confidence in Boeing, just like I do, he said on CNBC.', 'The Max 8 is a terrific aircraft.', 'I have confidence Boeing will address the issues.', 'And our customers have a lot of faith in Southwest Airlines.']",['737 Max grounding cost Alaska Airlines $ 150 million'],"['grounding 737 Max 9 January 5 incident blew hole side Alaska

against criticism from several other carriers after this months mid-flight breakage on a Boeing aircraft.', 'I have a lot of confidence both personally and professionally in David Calhoun and in Brian West, Ryanairs Michael OLeary said Monday, referring to Boeings CEO and chief financial officer respectively.', 'I know they are under attack from certain quarters.', 'They are doing a good job, they are turning that company around.', 'I think safety is their number one byword, he commented in a video posted on Ryanairs website to coincide with its third-quarter earnings.', 'Ryanair, which also owns Polish airline Buzz and Austrian carrier Lauda, is one of Boeings biggest customers and the planemakers performance is crucial to the budget carriers success — as evidenced by the way repeated delays in the delivery of Boeing aircraft have hampered Ryanairs growth.', 'Still, OLearys comments stand in sharp contrast to his previous scathing criticism of Boeings top brass.', 'In May 2022, he said the companys executives needed either an immediate reboot, or a boot up the a**.', 'His backing also represents a rare show of support for Boeing, which has come under fire from several of its other airline customers — including Alaska, American and United — after a part of a Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft shot out from the side of the fuselage only a few minutes into an Alaska Airlines flight, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing.', 'Calhoun — who was appointed to the top job in January 2020 as Boeing was already struggling with quality and safety issues — will unveil the planemakers full-year results Wednesday.', 'Like his predecessor Dennis Muilenberg, Calhoun is facing close scrutiny from customers, regulators and investors.', 'Shareholders are nursing heavy losses, with Boeings stock down around 17% since the incident on January 5.', 'The blowout has also raised questions about whether Boeing will be able to secure orders for its newer, larger Max 10 aircraft, which has yet to be approved for service by the US Federal Aviation Administration.', 'In an interview with CNBC last week, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said the airline was going to build a plan that doesnt have the Max 10 in it.', 'And Reuters reported Sunday that Kirby recently flew to the French city of Toulouse to discuss a potential deal to buy planes from Boeings archrival Airbus.', 'Ryanair, for its part, remains committed to the Max 10, having inked a $40 billion deal last year to buy up to 300 of the aircraft.', 'The Max 10 order is vital to Ryanairs growth, OLeary said Monday.', 'And if United or any other airline dont want to take their Max 10 orders, well be happy to step in…and take some of our Max 10 deliveries earlier.', 'The straw that broke the camels back: United CEOs frustration with Boeings problems Boeing are still making great aircraft, but they do have to improve quality control and the quality of what theyre delivering to their airline customers, he added, saying on an earnings call later that Ryanair was putting more of its own engineers in factories that build Boeing planes to run extra checks.', 'OLeary said Ryanairs growth had been held

John Richardson, former CEO of Continental Airlines Lawrence Kellner, former Inspector General of the Air Force Gen. Stayce Harris, and Carrier Global CEO David Gitlin.', 'Yet the continued flare-up of safety issues means that something is evidently getting lost in translation between the board and the manufacturing and assembly lines–and the challenge runs much deeper than any single incident.', 'How deeply the new quality control processes have permeated into Boeings production plants is an open question.', 'One wonders whether safety-focused voices are sufficiently empowered internally, as one whistleblower report claimed that Boeings own quality control systems were routinely ignored with under-pressure line inspectors sometimes providing false or erroneous information, which would be consistent with long-running complaints of underinvestment and inadequate self-policing.', 'Calhouns appointment of an external safety expert to review Boeings safety processes is a step in the right direction–but the FAA appears to be pushing for more wholesale and permanent changes, including embedding FAA or third-party monitors directly across Boeings supply chain, unsatisfied with mere auditing.', 'By all appearances, Boeing has lost functional oversight and control over its suppliers, an issue that has been exacerbated by a lack of supply chain diversification and accountability.', 'This is embodied by Boeings dysfunctional relationship with Spirit AeroSystems, which manufactures virtually all of Boeings fuselages.', 'For years, we have presciently and repeatedly warned about the latent risk posed by Spirit to Boeings operations, as the soft underbelly in the supply chain, and how former CEO Harry Stonecipher made a mistake by selling Spirit in 2005–but new whistleblower reports suggest that this dysfunctional marriage may be even worse than we appreciated.', 'According to a fresh report in the Seattle Times this week, citing an anonymous but credible whistleblower, Boeing engineers found no less than 392 instances of Spirit quality control failures over the last year.', 'In one instance, Spirits engineers supposedly repaired the issues, only for the Boeing inspector to discover that Spirit merely painted over the problematic parts, forcing Boeing to do any further repairs in-house.', 'Additional reports document how Spirit employees were encouraged not to report problems amidst a culture of fear, intimidation, and cost-cutting, with expert veteran engineers replaced by legions of cheaper and undertrained replacements.', 'Boeing has refused to respond to media requests for comment, citing ongoing investigations.', 'Meanwhile, Spirit has issued a statement saying that their primary focus is the quality and product integrity of the aircraft structures they deliver, adding that the company was working with Boeing on the matter and following regulators protocols.', 'Although the Spirit leadership ranks have almost completely turned over in the last four months amidst apparent pressure, and even if accomplished new CEO Pat Shanahan is committed to fixing Spirits process challenges, the last 20 years have shown that Spirit should not be a standalone company, period.', 'No matter how much Boeings financial whiz kids resist the prospect of diluting Boeings prized free cash flow with Spirits low-margin, capital-intensive business, and wobbly balance sheet, one has to wonder whether a sum equivalent to 3% of Boeings market capitalization is worth all the operational headaches, especially as Boeing continues to inject hundreds of millions into Spirit to keep it afloat.', 'The silver lining here for Boeing is that almost all of its suppliers are heavily dependent on Boeing and thus, all are aligned and motivated to urgently fix these underlying, long-deferred structural challenges together.', 'As the old Churchill saying goes, Never let a good crisis go to waste.', 'So far, Calhoun has won plaudits for his reassuring media interviews, all-staff meetings where he spoke about safety in personal terms as a father and grandfather, and desperately needed meetings with Congress in the days after the Alaska Air incident.', 'Similarly, Calhoun was praised for letting his airline customers send inspectors to any Boeing or Spirit manufacturing plant in response to the public condemnations of major customers such as the CEOs of Hawaiian, United, and Ryanair.', 'But getting the MAX 9s back into the sky may have been the easy part.', 'As the FAA digs in for protracted, intrusive oversight into Boeings internal process challenges in the months ahead, it will become progressively harder for Calhoun to control the narrative and continue fortifying public trust.', 'When Boeing faced similarly protracted regulatory reviews before, some of Calhouns predecessors of were ill-advised to hide behind exceedingly vague, impersonal legalese in deference to regulators and investigators–which did not end well.', 'This time around, Boeings challenge is even more acute since there will almost certainly need to be difficult but necessary tradeoffs in the months ahead.', 'For example, even though Boeing has said repeatedly that building and delivering more MAXs is their top priority this year, many analysts consider it likely that Boeing will need to lower the lofty production and financial targets laid out merely months ago, and will likely need to withhold guidance during its highly anticipated earnings call on Wednesday.', 'Some have also floated the prospect of internal reorganizations as accountability beckons.', 'Now more than ever, Justice Louis Brandeis quip that sunlight is the best disinfectant rings true.', 'Public safety and fortifying public trust must outweigh all short-term commercial impacts, no matter what investors or lawyers say.', 'Needless market panic, employee confusion, and sensationalized speculation can be avoided if tough but necessary moves are packaged and perceived as a part of a broader strategic plan to restore Boeings credibility, rather than being seen as reactionary impulsiveness or palace intrigue.', 'Furthermore, showing an accountable human face of leadership–rather than hiding behind bureaucratic processes or delegating bad news to subordinates–can go a long way in making bad news more palatable.', 'Many airline executives are now joking that the old mantra, if its not Boeing, Im not going will be at risk of turning into if its Boeing, its not going unless Boeing can revive its safety culture soon.', 'Where Boeing goes from here will largely depend on whether they are seen as having safe planes in the clouds–or whether they are seen as having their own heads in the clouds.', 'Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is the Lester Crown Professor in Management Practice and Senior Associate Dean at Yale School of Management.', 'He was named

safety exemption needed to certify a new model of the plane.']","['SEATTLE (AP) — Facing severe criticism after a door plug blew out on a 737 Max over Oregon this month, Boeing said Monday that it is withdrawing a request for a safety exemption needed to certify a new model of the plane.', 'The company asked federal regulators late last year to allow it to begin delivering its 737 Max 7 airliner to customers even though it does not meet a safety standard designed to prevent part of the engine housing from overheating and breaking off during flight.', 'But after a door panel blew out on a different version of the plane — a Max 9 — leaving a gaping hole in the fuselage of an Alaska Airlines flight out of Portland, Oregon, on Jan. 5, the companys quality control and commitment to safety have been questioned.', 'Last week, Democratic Sens.', 'Maria Cantwell, chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, and Tammy Duckworth, chair of its aviation safety subcommittee, urged the Federal Aviation Administration to deny the request.', 'Boeing said Monday it would withdraw it.', 'While Boeing never should have sought this exemption to put another new aircraft with a known safety defect into service in the first place, Im both relieved and appreciative that they are putting the flying publics safety first by withdrawing this petition, Duckworth, of Illinois, said in an emailed statement.', 'I hope this decision marks the beginning of a turnaround in Boeings safety culture.', 'In its announcement, the company said it was committed to being transparent, listening to all our stakeholders and taking action to strengthen safety and quality at Boeing.', 'The safety standard concerns an anti-icing system, and the issue affects other models of the 737 Max that are already flying.', 'Federal officials said last year that Boeing was working to fix the hazard on current Max planes, and in the meantime regulators urged pilots to limit the de-icing systems use in dry conditions because inlets around the engines could get too hot and parts of the housing could break away and strike the plane, possibly breaking windows and causing rapid decompression.', 'The issue affects only the Max because it has engine inlets made from carbon composite materials rather than metal.', 'The company had hoped to be able to deliver its new, smaller Max 7 to customers and have pilots operate the model under the guidance given to Max 8 and Max 9 pilots.', 'It asked for an exemption until May 2026 while it worked on a long-term fix.', 'In its statement, Boeing said that while it believed the exemption request followed established FAA processes to ensure safe operation, the company will instead incorporate an engineering solution that will be completed during the certification process.', 'This is good news, Cantwell said in an emailed statement Monday night.', 'I hope this means they can quickly develop a compliant design across other MAX planes.', 'The FAA grounded all Max 9s in the U.S. the day after the blowout.', 'Last week the agency approved the inspection and maintenance process to return the planes to flying, and Alaska and United Airlines — the only two U.S. airlines that fly Max 9s — began returning some to service in the last few days.', 'Southwest Airlines, the main customer for the Max 7, reported last week that it had removed the model from its fleet plans for 2024 while Boeing works with the FAA to certify it.', 'The FAA said last year that it had not received any reports of the overheating problem happening on Max flights, but that it issued the warning to pilots because of the severity of the risk, which was discovered on a test flight.', 'The 737 Max went into service in May 2017.', 'Two of the planes crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people.', 'All Max jets were grounded worldwide for nearly two years while the company made changes to an automated flight-control system that pushed the nose down based on faulty sensor readings.', 'More recently, Max deliveries have been interrupted to fix manufacturing flaws, and last month the company told airlines to inspect the planes for a possible loose bolt in the rudder-control system.', 'Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and CEO Stan Deal said in a message to Boeing employees Friday that the companys most immediate goal is to help

Okay.', 'Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.', 'Youre all very welcome to the Q3 results call.', 'As you see earlier this morning on our ryanair.com website, we published our Q3 results together with an MDA and a QA section with myself and CFO, Neil Sorahan.', 'A couple of quick themes.', 'As you see, we reported a Q3 profit after tax of €15 million.', 'Traffic and fares were ahead of the prior year, but closing Christmas and New Year loads and yields were softer than previously expected, as we had to lower prices somewhat in response to the very sudden, but surprising but very welcome removal of flights from most of the major OTA pirate websites in early December.', 'Profit after tax, however, for the 9 months ended 31 December was up 39% at €2.19 billion.', 'Prior year, it was €1.58 billion.', 'Just to touch on some brief Q3 highlights.', 'The traffic grew 7% to 41 million.', 'Revenue per passenger was up 9%.', 'Average fares were up 13%, mainly due to a very strong Christmas and the October bank holiday weekend and ancillary revenues up 2%.', 'MSCI raised their ESG rating on Ryanair from a BBB to an A in December.', 'Our fuel bill rose €320 million in the quarter, up 35% to €1.2 billion.', 'At the quarter end, we had 136 B737 Gamechangers in the total fleet that was significantly behind the original deliveries due to Boeing delays.', 'More importantly, going forward, our fuel hedging, weve extended fuel hedging.', 'We have 65% of our FY 25 fuel now hedged at $79 per barrel.', 'This year, we are hedged at $89 per barrel.', 'So we have already banked a saving of €450 million into FY 25.', 'And as you will all be aware, we have ended the first interim dividend of €0.175 per share is payable on the February 28.', 'I think just to touch on growth in fleet.', 'At the end of Q3, weve taken delivery of 136 737 Gamechangers.', 'We now expect to have up to 174 of these aircraft in our fleet by the end of June in time for peak summer 2024, thats up 50 aircraft from summer 2023.', 'That would still be 7 aircraft short of our contracted deliveries due to Boeing delivery delays.', 'However, those new aircraft means we have a bumper summer 2024 schedule now on sale.', 'It includes 169 new routes, our first 11 domestic routes in Morocco and our first summer with 23 routes in Albania, are in to and from Tirana, the capital city of Albania.', 'While travel demand remains high, we expect summer 24 EU short-haul capacity to be behind where it was in summer 23 as a considerable number of our competitors ground the A320 aircraft in Europe due to the Pratt  Whitney engine issues and Boeing delivery delays constrain our growth from 57 to 50 aircraft.', 'We are continuing to work closely with Boeing to minimize delivery delays and we have invested in additional engineering over – Ryanair engineering oversight to improve the quality control in both Wichita and Seattle.', 'The recent MAX 9 grounding was a disappointing setback, but we welcome the ungrounding of the MAX 9 last week.', 'Ryanair do not operate any MAX 9 variant.', 'There are no MAX 9 aircraft in Europe, and therefore, it is largely a U.S. issue.', 'However, Neil visited in Seattle in January, met with Boeings senior management and we urge them and they have agreed to increase their quality assurance resources on the ground in Wichita and Seattle.', 'We are putting more engineers into Wichita and Seattle to run extra checks on our deliveries, but also on our recent 737 deliveries, weve noted improvements in the quality with fewer delivery defects on the 12 aircraft we got in the fourth quarter before Christmas.', 'However, we do believe Boeing have more work to do to improve quality and reduce delivery delays.', 'But – and I want to stress this, we are fully supportive of the initiatives that David Calhoun and Brian West are taking to improve Boeings performance and production.', 'It is critical, we believe, to Boeings continued performance that we support Calhoun and West.', 'I think they are a good team.', 'I have concerns about the management in Seattle, but I have a lot of confidence in Calhoun and Brian West.', 'I think they are on the right track.', 'The MAX 9 grounding was an unfortunate event, and it does indicate that quality does need to be improved in Boeing, but we are very supportive and a lot of confidence in what Calhoun is doing under his leadership.', 'We welcome – on the OTAs, this is a significant event in December.', 'The timing of the OTA taking, as I said, was a bit unfortunate, because it was the first week in December.', 'With Christmas coming, you cant just go in and open up and dump seats to counteract that.', 'We think historically, these OTA pirates generally account for between 10% and 15% of our volume.', 'So a sudden removal of that meant, we saw a sudden – or a very short-term dip in our bookings.', 'We would normally respond to that by opening up price promotions, but we didnt want to do that in the run into Christmas.', 'We therefore think well take a hit of 1% or 2% on load factor in December and January.', 'We will take it into hit on yields during December and January, but we think it will be short-lived and we are happy with the forward bookings, particularly out into February and March, although March is slightly – is artificially enhanced by having the first half of Easter in that.', 'Much more important for Ryanair and our passengers is to convert these OTA pirates into what we now would call kind of approved OTA partners.', 'The partnership agreement we signed last week with loveholidays who were our fourth largest OTA and Kiwi.com this morning, who are our largest – where our largest OTA pirates, are critical, we think to protecting customers from OTA overcharges and scams.', 'As part of this agreement, we now give these two approved OTA direct feed of inventory from the ryanair.com website and they agree as part of the deal, no overcharging of passengers for either airfares or for any of our ancillaries.', 'The bookings are made directly in the ryanair.com website with the customers actual and real e-mail address and real payment details, so that if we need to send a customer an e-mail or some flight information, it goes directly to the customer, it doesnt get lost in some OTA pirate fake e-mail address.', 'And whenever we have to refund to passengers, we can now make the bookings directly to the passengers.', 'We think this is the way forward and we will continue to campaign to outlaw the illegal screen scraping and the customer overcharging and scamming being undertaken by so many others of these OTA pirates and converted them to the same system or the same mechanism that we now agree with loveholidays and Kiwi.', 'Looking forward to the summer 2024, we expect airlines will continue to consolidate.', 'We expect capacity will be constrained by both the consolidation by the lack of aircraft deliveries post-COVID across Europe.', 'And I think the A320 fleet grounding this summer, we expect about 10% of Europes A320 fleet to be grounded for the – while they address the Pratt  Whitney engine issues and that this will mean tight supply for summer 2024.', 'And while we still have 50 additional aircraft into that marketplace, we dont have the original 57 we had hoped for.', 'So we think there is going to be a reasonably strong summer pricing.', 'Already today, our bookings are running about 5% ahead of where they were, forward bookings into the summer about 5% ahead of where they were this time last year.', 'Pricing is up by a low single-digit percentage.', 'Again, some of that, I think, is a factor of the fact that the first half of Easter has moved into March.', 'But therefore, there is less of an impact of Easter pricing in April.', 'But much work remains to be done, but we are very pleased with where we are for summer 2024.', 'In terms of outlook, we are targeting 183.5 million passengers in the current year.', 'That will still be a monumental achievement.', 'The original budget was 185 million.', 'But if you take the ATC – its been over 60 days of ATC strikes, thats cost us over 1 million seats.', 'The Tel Aviv cancellations, which have been running since the end of – since the end of November, thats cost us about another 600,000 seats and the Boeing delivery delays have meant weve had to truncate both the summer 2024 – summer 23 schedule and our winter 24 schedule.', 'So, it will still be a very strong performance.', 'However, as a result of these lower load factors, particularly in Q3 and the kicking in of some higher productivity pay agreements with pilot unions across Belgium, Italy and in the UK, these are productivity enhancements that we intend to rollout to most of the other by agreement with the other pilot unions and groups between now and summer 2024, which will significantly improve our operational resilience and reduce pilot attrition.', 'We now expect full year 24 ex-fuel unit cost to rise by about €2.50.', 'That would still leave a dramatically wider cost gap between Ryanair and our main European competitor airlines, two of whom reported last week.', 'Q4, which is traditionally the weakest quarter will also be impacted by the partial unwind of free ETS carbon credits in the January 1, but we will benefit from a strong first half of Easter traffic falling into late March, although this is unlikely to offset the weaker than previously expected load factors and yields in late Q3 and early Q4.', 'We are therefore this morning narrowing our full year FY 24 profit after tax guidance to a range of between €1.85 billion to €1.95 billion.', 'It was previously €1.85 billion to €2.05 billion.', 'So we think the number will come in just under €2 billion for the full year.', 'However, this guidance and the full year results still remains heavily dependent upon avoiding unforeseen adverse events in Q4, such as the Ukraine war, the Israel Hamas conflict and any further Boeing delivery delays, which might damage us in the run into Easter.', 'We have also given you a full update or we have attached to the release, a full update on the OTA pirate situation.', 'I think this has been one of the most dramatic victories for Ryanair in recent years.', 'And I would always be happy to take a short-term pain if its getting rid of OTA pirate scamming and overcharging our customers and moving those into a more cooperative working with us.', 'It also, I think the new agreement this morning with loveholidays and with Kiwi exposes the falsehood of some of these OTA claims that Ryanair is just trying to eliminate OTA.', 'We are not – we have, for many years, worked with OTAs like Google Flight who just – who are an honest price transparency website, but who send passengers directly to Ryanair to make the booking.', 'The reason we have a problem with the OTA pirates is the illegal screen scraping of our digital – of our data and then using that to scam customers for excessive airfares, inflated ancillary services, and in some cases, charging them for non-existing services such as refund insurance and/or change fees, while its a non-changeable ticket.', 'But I think its been a very good month or 2 months work and is long-term very much in Ryanairs interest and in the interest of our consumers that they can get access to our low fares, our low cost ancillary services without being scammed by some intermediaries.', 'Do you want to – anything you want to highlight in terms of the finances, the balance sheet and/or the dividend.', 'I suppose just on the balance sheet, ended the quarter very strongly with just over €2.9 billion in gross cash and importantly, net cash balance €150 million.', 'We continue to be the most highly rated airline in the world with a BBB+ rating from Fitch and SP.', 'And a big advantage that we have in these markets is unencumbered Boeing 747 fleet, 546 unencumbered aircraft.', 'And so we are generating net interest income in the business at a time when our competitors are refinancing or taking on expensive leases.', 'So thats a big competitive advantage that we have.', 'You touched on the hedging, but I think we shouldnt underestimate the benefit of the certainty that we have now in our hedging out to the end of March 2025, €450 million worth of savings being locked in and one are very volatile markets at this point in time.', 'And then, of course, we have got our first interim dividend at the end of next month, €0.175 per share and well have something similar again after AGM approval in September.', 'And thats pretty much all I wanted to add, Michael.', 'Michael OLeary: Okay.', '[indiscernible], then well open it up to QA, please.', 'See

you, Bill.', 'So as you look at this situation at Boeing, you recently wrote about the leaders that led up to Dave Calhoun, the current CEO.', 'Where did the problem start, briefly, if you can summarize, and how does he fix it?', 'BILL GEORGE: You know, weve had five CEOs that have played the short-term game for the last 25 years, starting back with Phil Condit, who instead of gaining share, he bought out McDonnell Douglas, which led him into a lot of trouble, and more importantly, moved the headquarters away from Seattle.', 'And then you had a succession of CEOs.', 'And if you just look at the stock over the last five years, its down 44%.', 'Cost investors about $100 billion.', 'So these CEOs have gotten away from what Boeings all about.', 'In the last five years, they have bought back 121% the dividends and stock buybacks, 121% of their earnings.', 'Of course, theyve lost money for the last three years.', 'So heres a company thats in trouble, but America cant afford to have it be in trouble.', 'This is an American icon that must be restored.', 'And so I think theyve got to get back to longer term focus.', 'Now Ive got five ideas on how to do that.', 'Number one, theyve got to restore their whole quality system.', 'If I were Dave Calhoun, I would shut down the entire factory for a week and have everyone focus on quality.', 'Theyve got to change not just quick fix-- or lets fix this door plug.', 'No, theyve got to fix their whole system.', 'Second, theyve got to redo the whole supply chain.', 'They keep farming out things to unreliable suppliers, like Spirit Aero.', 'And they cant even keep the bolts on a plane.', 'Third, they need to design a new single-aisle aircraft.', 'The 737, their workhorse aircraft, is spent-- it was designed 60 years ago.', 'Think how much technology has changed in 60 years, and they dont update.', 'They just keep changing bits and pieces.', 'And they create more problems as they go.', 'And frankly, if I were they, I would move the headquarters back to Seattle, and Dave Calhoun should move back there himself.', 'And finally, they need to really take a look at their balance sheet.', 'Theyve bought back so much stock, they have negative shareholders equity.', 'Theyve got $54 billion in short- and long-term debt.', 'And theyre in trouble.', 'And they need to restore the balance sheet to a healthy balance sheet and generate some cash flow, which they havent done for a long time.', 'JOSH LIPTON: And so, Bill, so youve laid out the strategy here, what you think Dave Calhoun and his team there need to do.', 'Any evidence, Bill, to you that Calhoun and the C-suite of Boeing are going to take on any of these measures youre suggesting?', 'BILL GEORGE: Not so far.', 'Well, he said hes going to fix quality.', 'But see, theyre fixing it a piece at a time.', 'Theyre not fixing the quality system.', 'But no, he said, hes been in office now-- this is his fifth year.', 'And he said, were not going to have a new aircraft this decade.', 'They had the former head of commercial aviation, Alan Mulally, had a new single-aisle aircraft that they canceled after he left and went to Ford and turned around Ford.', 'Theyve not gone ahead with that.', 'They need to do that.', 'And thats going to take seven or eight years.', 'But they just need to get with that right now.', 'Theyre on the verge of losing longtime customers like United Airlines.', 'United Airlines CEO is in Toulouse this week, talking to Airbus about can they get more production out of them.', 'American, Southwest, very loyal.', 'They are all threatening now to say, if you dont get your act together, were out of here.', 'And in fact, one of them said this is a straw that breaks the camels back.', 'So theyve got to restore themselves as Americas leading aviation supplier.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Bill, is Dave Calhoun the right guy?', 'BILL GEORGE: Well, so far, he seemed like he was, but he has not demonstrated it.', 'He is-- hes not-- he once ran GEs jet engine business.', 'But he has got to really step up to the long-term issues.', 'Hes acting like a short-term CEO.', 'And thats not going to get it.', 'Theyre not going to cut it.', 'Yes, hes got to do the short-term things, but hes got to have a long-term strategy in place, and he hasnt done that yet.', 'So Im waiting to see, will he come forward with that on Wednesday?', 'But thats going to be a key time for him to face down investors.', 'Its not just about door plugs.', 'Theres a lot more to it than that.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, most definitely.', 'Bill, as you mentioned, he is a GE alum.', 'And a number of those other leaders you mentioned were also veterans of GE.', 'Is this yet another sort of hit to GEs one-time reputation as a factory for quality executives?', 'BILL GEORGE: No doubt.', 'Harry Stonecipher, the former CEO that got him in a lot of this trouble, came out and publicly said-- 20 years ago, he said, were not going to act like an engineering firm anymore.', 'Were going to act like-- were going to run this like a business.', 'What an insult to people that have generated tens of billion dollars in profits.', 'But he said that, and that changed the whole culture to a short-term, finance-based culture instead of a quality aviation design culture.', 'And that was the key.', 'And then they passed over Alan Mulally, called him back-- Stonecipher back.', 'Mulally should have had the job, frankly.', 'That would have changed everything.', 'So I think Mike Calhoun needs to surround himself with someone, maybe get in a COO if he can-- or maybe just be chairman and bring in a CEO who really is a top aviation expert.', 'JOSH LIPTON: And Bill, Ill get you out of here on this.', 'If youre a viewer watching this right now, maybe you have capital committed to Boeing, how worried do you think you should be, Bill, about Boeings business and the reputational hit its taken and potential impact to orders here in the quarters and years ahead?', 'BILL GEORGE: I think you ought to be very worried if youd invested-- five years ago, if you had $1,000 invested in Boeing, itd be worth three times as much as if youd put it into the-- just into the SP 500.', 'So yeah, I think one should be very concerned about the long-term issues, not just the short term.', 'So you can get short-term fixes, but they dont solve fundamental problems of a culture thats moved away from design and quality and safety.', 'And theyve got to get back to that.', 'And if they dont do that, they arent going to have a future.', 'America needs them, though.', 'So we cant just sit back and say, oh, well, Boeings going to go the route of GE.', 'We have to ensure we have a great company in Boeing.', 'And I think thats essential.', 'And so Im not giving up on them at all.', 'But I do feel like theyve got to get back to fundamentals of how you run a business.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Bill George, we always really appreciate your insight here at Yahoo Finance.', 'Thanks so much for joining us.', 'BILL GEORGE: Thank you for having me.', 'Its great to be back with you.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Take care.']",['Five thing Boeing get back track : Bill

National Safety Transportation Board, which is investigating, is expected to release its preliminary findings soon.', 'Thats the Boeing of today and the last five years.', 'But it wasnt always that way.', 'It wasnt that long ago that Boeings reputation was that of a staid industrial giant, known for building the safest, most advanced planes in the sky.', 'It helped introduce the world to commercial jet travel.', 'Pilots and others in the industry, as well as members of the flying public, summed up their confidence in the company with the expression, If its not Boeing, Im not going.', 'The company still sells\xa0coffee cups\xa0and\xa0t-shirts\xa0with that slogan.', 'So how in the world did the company whose brand was once synonymous with safety become mired in reputational disaster – to the point where at least one travel site has a feature that allows passengers to avoid Boeing 737 Max planes altogether.', 'Experts and critics say that Boeings woes have been years in the making, some pointing to the result of a shift in corporate culture that started at the top and put profits ahead of the safety and engineering prowess for which it was once praised, placing not only its future, but the passengers on its planes, at grave risk.', 'While Boeing denies there has been such a shift away from safety and excellence, what is indisputable is that its engineering and manufacturing problems have contributed to a series of shocking incidents, two of which resulted in the deaths more than 300 people combined.', 'Boeing simultaneously became a financial basket case, reporting cumulative net losses of more than $26 billion, and counting, over the last five years, with no end to the red ink in sight.', 'Boeing executives insist that quality and safety are still a top priority for the company, and the problems of recent years have only increased its focus on quality and safety.', 'Asked for comment on the claim that it now puts profits ahead of quality and safety, the company pointed to a recent statement by CEO Dave Calhoun.', 'Over the last several years, weve added rigor around our quality processes, hired tens of thousands of engineers and mechanics, advanced key investments in our future, transformed our functions and gradually increased our production rates, he told investors in October.', 'Most importantly, weve worked hard to instill a culture of speaking up and transparently bringing forward any issue, no matter the size, so we can get things right for the future.', 'A week after Calhoun made the remark, the company delivered a 737 Max 9 to Alaska Air, the fourth it had built for the carrier that month.', 'Code letters N704AL, the jets door plug blew out while the plane was mid-air, less than 10 weeks after it was delivered, just minutes into the January 5 flight.', 'The company also pointed to what it called a quality stand down, on Thursday for its 737 factory teams in Renton, Washington in which it halted production to focus on quality issues.', 'Boeing announced the move in the wake of a recently expanded federal probe into the companys manufacturing practices following the Alaska Air incident and plans for Congressional hearings into its practices.', 'The first 737 Max 9 planes that were grounded after that incident returned to service on Friday, and most are expected to be back in the air by the end of this week.', 'Our long-term focus is on improving our quality so that we can regain the confidence of our customers, our regulator and the flying public.', 'Frankly, we have disappointed and let them down, said a statement by Stan Deal, the head of Boeings commercial airplane unit, in a statement to employees following that return to service.', 'Over the last century, the people of Boeing have faced and overcome significant challenges.', 'This is one of those times.', 'We have to be better.', 'We have to deliver perfect airplanes each and every time.', 'But critics say this crisis is unlike any earlier problems at the company, arguing that despite Boeings assurances, they believe there has been a cultural change within the company in the last 25 years that has put profits over safety and quality.', 'Leadership is more concerned with\xa0getting the planes out the door than quality, Ed Pierson, a former Boeing executive who is now the executive director of the Foundation for Aviation Safety, a public interest group, told CNN last week.', 'He said planes are still being produced today with flaws not being caught.', 'The spark for the conflagration that has recently consumed Boeing might date back decades.', 'After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the huge American defense contractors began to consolidate.', 'Fearful of their own survival without a communist enemy stalking NATOs borders\xa0they\xa0began to merge with one another.', 'In the decade after the end of the Cold War, 51 major American defense and aerospace contractors\xa0became just five huge companies.', 'And one of the five left standing was Boeing, newly merged in 1997 with competitor McDonell Douglas.', 'Critics said that before the merger, Boeing had a reputation as a company run by people with engineering backgrounds who cared about quality and safety first.', 'But those critics say the merger put the company in the hands of executives with a finance background, who put profits as their top goal.', 'Boeing had a reputation before the merger of a company where engineers were high church, Ron Epstein, an\xa0aerospace analyst at Bank of America, told CNN.', 'It resulted in Boeing not being as profitable as some comparable manufacturers, he said.', 'But after the merger he said, everything had to be cost-justified.', 'On paper, Boeing was the company that bought McDonnell Douglas.', 'But many of the leadership ranks became filled with McDonnell Douglas veterans, not Boeing executives.', 'Many of them had financial backgrounds, not the engineering backgrounds of those who had run Boeing in the past.', 'Or they came from outside of the company, such as from General Electric, where cost-cutting and improved efficiency was a near religion.', 'One of those was Jim McNerney, who became Boeing CEO in 2005, after a career that started at consumer products maker Procter  Gamble, included time at management consultant McKinsey  Co., and was followed by years at GE.', 'He was CEO of 3M before being tapped to run Boeing, without any engineering and limited aerospace experience.', 'Under this leadership the company moved away, figuratively and literally, from its Pacific Northwest roots, where top executives had been intimately familiar with the massive assembly lines there where commercial jets were built, and any problems that might be developing there.', 'In 2001 it moved its headquarters to Chicago.', 'And in the midst of various crises in recent years, it moved its headquarters again in 2022,\xa0not back to Seattle, but to a\xa0suburb of Washington, DC,\xa0near the Pentagon, Capitol Hill, and its various regulators, like the FAA.', 'Ironically the move to Washington came the same week Airbus\xa0revealed that it was increasing production of commercial jets at its factory in\xa0Mobile, Alabama, only seeming to drive home the point to critics that Boeing was moving in the wrong direction.', 'One company is saying Were going to build lots of jets.', 'The other is saying Were going to lobby the Pentagon and Congress for defense dollars.', 'Its a big contrast, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory and a leading aerospace analyst.', 'Boeing became more dependent on suppliers to build more and more of its planes, seeking to limit its role to joining together the parts.', 'And it spun-off some of the operations it had depended upon previously.', 'Supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which builds the fuselages for Boeings planes, including the 737 Max, was created in 2005 after Boeing sold its Wichita division and Oklahoma operations raising $900 million in cash by doing so.', 'And in 2009, about a year after weathering a 58-day strike at its unionized plants in Washington state, the company announced plans for a non-union plant in right-to-work South Carolina to assemble its new, most advanced jet, the 787 Dreamliner, giving it a factory with lower pay that wasnt at risk of going on strike in the future.', 'Calhoun, Boeings current CEO, took over in January 2020, nine months into the grounding of the 737 Max following two fatal crashes.', 'He also has no engineering background, having served as senior managing director and head of portfolio operations at investing firm The Blackstone Group, CEO of Nielsen and spending 26 years at GE.', 'Just over a year and a half later, after the pandemic reduced demand for the long-range Dreamliner due to the drop in international travel, Calhoun and Boeing decided it needed to\xa0preserve cash\xa0and could no longer justify two 787 plants.', 'It had a choice between consolidating production to a veteran plant in Washington state staffed by unionized employees and a non-union South Carolina plant.', 'It decided to close the unionized line in Washington and keep the South Carolina plant.', 'But it soon had quality problems with the 787 Dreamliners being produced there, leading to two costly halts in deliveries, one lasting over a year.', 'Although Boeing says it values its worldwide staff, it made deep staff cuts during the economic downturn caused by the pandemic, offering buyouts to more senior workers.', 'The loss of expertise has proven devastating, Bank of Americas Epstein said.', 'A key variable is your workforce, he said.', 'You want it to be as experienced as possible.', 'When its all said and done, how much do you really save closing the unionized plant?', 'Aviation safety advocate Pierson served as a senior manager at Boeings 737 factory after a career in the military.', 'He left the company in 2018, just months before the first fatal crash.', 'He told CNN his frustration with top management attitudes on quality led him to quit.', 'In 2019 he testified to Congress that there was evidence that the 737 Max was having production quality issues, including planes being delivered to airlines that had faulty hardware or other system malfunctions, problems that involved more than a dozen safety issues, some of which he described as serious.', 'He recounted that he had recommended a halt in production of the 737 Max to deal with quality issues in the months ahead of the first crash.', 'He said the boss to whom he had made the recommendation told him, We cant do that, I cant do that.', 'A terrifying 10 minute flight adds to years of Boeings quality control problems I pushed back, explaining that I had seen operations in the military shut down over less substantial safety issues, and those organizations had national security responsibilities, he testified.', 'He said his supervisor responded tersely, The military isnt a profit-making organization.', 'Other experts agree with Pierson that despite its claims of being concerned with safety and quality, Boeings actions suggest otherwise.', 'Youre looking at a management team whose idea of acknowledging the problem is to readjust the cash flow numbers for next year, said Aboulafia in an interview with CNN.', 'And then disaster struck.', 'The first fatal\xa0crash of a 737 Max\xa0occurred\xa0in Indonesia in October 2018, the\xa0second in Ethiopia in March 2019, killing a total of 346 people.', 'It led to a 20-month grounding of all 737 Max jets.', 'In addition to the horrifying loss of life, it cost the company more than $21 billion, making it one of the costliest corporate disasters on record, as well as one of the most deadly.', 'After the first crash, Boeing successfully pushed to keep the planes in the air.', 'Even after the second crash, as airline regulators around the world\xa0grounded the jet, Boeing pushed the FAA to hold off on its own grounding order, saying that it had full confidence in the safety\xa0of the 737 Max and that based on the information currently available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance to airlines.', 'When the FAA gave in to\xa0global and public pressure to announce its\xa0own grounding, Boeing said it accepted the move out of an abundance of caution.', 'Eventually it was a design flaw in the Max that was blamed for the two fatal crashes, as a feature meant to stop the planes from climbing too fast and stalling instead forced the nose of the planes downward.', 'But critics of Boeing say the problem wasnt just the flawed design of the jet that led to the deaths, it was the decisions that Boeing made to not quickly acknowledge the problem with design after the first crash, and have a grounding take place at that time, which could have prevented the second crash.', 'In the light most favorable to Boeing, the first crash was an accident, the second crash is a crime, said Robert Clifford, the attorney suing Boeing on behalf of families of the victims of the second crash, the one in Ethiopia, in an interview with CNN.', 'He said if the plane had been grounded immediately, Boeing might have ended up fixing the problem much faster, and with less expense, as well as preventing the second crash.', 'They gambled with peoples lives and the people lost, he said.', 'In 2021 Boeing admitted to liability in the two crashes, agreeing to pay compensatory damages, which allowed the company to avoid the possibility of having to pay far more in punitive damages.', 'Boeing is committed to ensuring that all families who lost loved ones in the accidents are fully and fairly compensated for their loss, the company said in a statement at that time.', 'By accepting responsibility, Boeings agreement with the families allows the parties to focus their efforts on determining the appropriate compensation for each family.', 'It has also agreed to pay a $2.5 billion fine to settle charges it defrauded\xa0the FAA when it first won approval of the flawed 737 Max.', 'I firmly believe that entering into this resolution is the right thing for us to do — a step that appropriately acknowledges how we fell short of our values and expectations, Calhoun said at that time.', 'But that agreement was criticized by the families of victims of the Ethiopian air crash as well as members of Congress as being far too lenient.', 'About 70% of the $2.5 billion fine it agreed to pay was money it had already agreed to pay as compensation to its airline customers.', 'Pierson said the probe that followed the second crash revealed\xa0Boeing executives\xa0were more concerned with continued production than finding the cause of the crash and fixing it.', 'They absolutely prioritized the delivery of planes over the investigation, he said.', 'Pierson said the design flaw, as problematic as it was, was not the total problem that led to the crash.', 'He said the quality of the work that would produce various malfunctions while the planes were in flight was just as significant as the design flaw.', 'He points to a report from the Ethiopian Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau that looked at both fatal crashes and found that These accidents were triggered by production quality defects that… presented as intermittent system malfunctions.', 'Without the build quality issues causing malfunctions, the design flaw feature of the plane that forced the nose of the plane down would not have turned on, and the flights would not have crashed, according to the Ethiopian report.', 'But that finding got little attention as the US National Transportation Safety Board and the FAA focused on design flaws rather than the build\xa0quality issues, Pierson said.', 'Eventually the probe provided an ugly look at the\xa0decision-making process\xa0at Boeing.', 'Internal communications released during the 737 Max grounding showed one employee describing the jet as designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.', 'Boeings release of the documents included an apology to the FAA, Congress, airlines, and the public.', 'An ironic part of Boeings focus on profits is that it has resulted in a company that is\xa0in the worst financial shape in its more than 100-year history, with five years of deep losses already,\xa0and more expected losses ahead.', 'As recently as 2018 Boeing was riding high, reporting revenue of more than $100 billion for the first time in its history and projecting more growth to come.', 'It had just started deliveries of the 737 Max the year before.', 'The short-term focus on profits was, indeed, producing profits.', 'At least for a little while.', 'Its rival Airbus was the one struggling, on the verge of abandoning its $25 billion mistake, the A380 superjumbo jet that had turned out to be a white elephant with little demand from airlines or passengers.', 'Despite that, the two companies were neck-and-neck in orders and deliveries.', 'But in less than a decade, all that has changed.', 'Airbus delivered 735 commercial jets last year.', 'Net orders and the backlog of jets each is waiting to build show a larger imbalance.', 'And while Airbus is forecast to report adjusted net income of 4.3 billion euros, or $4.7 billion profit, for 2023 when it reports results, Boeing just reported an operating loss of $3.2 billion for the year.', 'Aboulafia said the short-sighted push for profits has put the company at\xa0a severe competitive disadvantage to Airbus, and that Calhoun and other top managers at Boeing, as well as its board, need to go if the company is to have a chance to turn things around.', 'Despite the losses and severely weakened market position of Boeing, there is little chance it could go out of business.', 'The airlines around the world that have already bought Boeing planes basically need to keep using those models, whatever the problems.', 'Commercial pilots are certified on specific models\xa0and are not able to easily move\xa0from single-aisle to widebody versions of Boeing jets, let alone between a Boeing and an Airbus jet.', 'And having different models means the airlines need to have a large, expensive supply of spare parts on hand to keep their planes in the air.', 'And any Boeing customer who canceled their orders today would have to get in line behind a backlog of more than 8,600 jets that Airbus has already agreed to build for its existing customers.', 'Its a very weird industry.', 'It has high barriers to entry and only two players.', 'You can get away with nonsense like this, said Aboulafia.', 'Pierson said incident reports on planes that Boeing continues to build, while not nearly as dramatic as the Alaska Air incident, suggest the\xa0pressure to put profits over quality remains, despite Boeings claims.', 'The company has gutted quality control so they can produce more airplanes, he said.', 'The employees are completely overwhelmed.', 'Everybody is focused on the Max 9, and rightfully so.', 'That incident should never have happened.', 'But there are issues on other planes.', 'It has become a recipe for disaster.']","['Boeing known safety engineering .', 'critic say emphasis profit changed']","['Part fuselage blowing shortly takeoff , leaving gaping hole plane , phone clothing ripped away
