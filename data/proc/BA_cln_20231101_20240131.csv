Director of Investor Relations and FPA.', 'Thank you, Seb, and good morning, everyone.', 'With me today are Spirits President and Chief Executive Officer, Pat Shanahan and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Suchinski.Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections or goals we may include in our discussion today are likely to involve risks, including those detailed in our earnings release, in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement at the end of this web presentation.In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures we use when discussing our results.With that, Id like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Pat Shanahan.', 'Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everyone.', 'Welcome to Spirits Third Quarter Earnings Call.', 'It is a privilege to be here with you today representing Spirit AeroSystems and our global team.', 'I want to thank the Board for entrusting me with this responsibility while we search for a permanent CEO.', 'On behalf of the entire Board, we thank Tom Gentile for 7 years of dedication and service with Spirit.Im very familiar with Spirit and its operations from my time at Boeing and as a Board member for the past 2 years.', 'My trips to Wichita go back to the 90s, where we tackled new programs and production rate increases together.Now I am the supplier, not the customer, but the dynamics are the same.', 'Over the past several years, Spirit has expanded its portfolio of commercial and defense businesses.', 'However, the core of the business, designing and building large-scale aerostructures, has not changed.Ive been in the role for about 30 days now.', 'To borrow a military acronym, my approach since the first day has been TACOMO: Take charge and move out, meaning Im with the Spirit team at all levels, deep into program and production rate plans and engaging with all our major customers.My initial impressions are that we have a strong team and tremendous capabilities, but we need better precision in our plans, better performance and the right schedule.We are manufacturing a product weve produced in large quantity at high rates before, as opposed to being in the throes of complex commercial development while concurrently ramping up production.My focus is simultaneously stabilizing operations, delivering on our customer commitments and strengthening Spirit financially.', 'I want 100% alignment with our commercial and defense customers.', 'Im driving performance every day.', 'And most importantly, building cohesive teams that view working together as the most effective way to perform and win.The recent agreement with Boeing was an important step in the right direction.', 'The strengthened partnership will support our shared goals of both companies to execute the increasing production rates.', 'Also, Im devoting increased attention to our other major OEM commercial partnership.', 'Let me touch briefly on our strategy.', 'I do not intend to wait for my replacement before moving forward.Regarding diversification, I will narrow the aperture.', 'I dont have an appetite for next square adjacencies.', 'We at Spirit will build on our core defense and aftermarket success.My principal goal is to be cash flow positive as soon as possible.', 'Executing on programs, increasing deliveries is the most crucial lever to achieve that goal.', 'However, we have other cash levers to pull to accelerate many of the activities previously developed, along with new ones we are uncovering every day.Shifting the discussion to market demand.', 'Its incredible what a difference a couple of years make.', 'We are witnessing unprecedented demand.', 'Im encouraged by the unbelievable organic growth in our core segment with a $42 billion backlog.', 'The demand comes with challenges that we must mitigate as part of a new world that is less stable.I recognize we have disappointed our stakeholders.', 'We want to restore confidence in the company.', 'Im passionate about this industry, our customers and Spirit.', 'Im in Kansas most days because this is where most of the action is.', 'The people here and, quite frankly, at all our operations have been warm and welcoming.', 'Id like to provide you guidance for 2024, but Im not prepared to at this time.', 'My plan is to give guidance on our next earnings call, consistent with previous practices.Ill now turn the call over to Mark to review with you our third quarter financial results.', 'Thank you, Pat, and good morning, everyone.', 'As many of you know, I have known Pat as a member of our Board for a while now, and I look forward to working closely with him as we navigate the path forward.', 'I can tell you that we are aligned on our priorities and the trajectory of Spirit.Now turning to recent events.', 'We are pleased to have reached a memorandum of agreement with Boeing in October, which we expect will result in improved cash flow over the next several years.', 'I want to highlight the financial impacts of the agreement, which will be reflected in our financial results beginning in the fourth quarter.First, the MOA established an immediate higher price on the 787 program, with reductions to pricing on the 737 program beginning in 2026.', 'We expect to record a reversal of a forward loss and material right obligations of $350 million to $370 million as a result of the 787 price increase.With this, a majority of the existing 787 forward loss liability will be reversed, and we anticipate positive margins on the program beginning in the first half of 2025 as production rates increase.Next, the MOA provided for a broad release of existing claims and liabilities, which will include the reversal of $23 million of anticipated claims previously recorded related to the 737 vertical fan attach fitting issue.In addition, we will receive funding for certain tooling and capital through 2025 on the 737 and 787 programs.', 'We will repay the majority of the capital funded related to the 787 program beginning in 2025.', 'In October, we received an advance on the total expected CapEx funding of $100 million.', 'Between now and 2025, there will be some timing differences between the receipt of funds and the CapEx spending, which will be reflected on the statement of cash flows.And finally, the repayment dates were extended on the previously disclosed $100 million -- $180 million advance of customer financing received in the second quarter of this year.', 'We will now make repayments of $90 million in December of 2025 and equal repayments of $45 million in December of 2026 and 2027.The MOA strengthens the relationships with our largest customer and further aligns the parties for future success.', 'Broadly speaking, the agreement provides increased cash over the next several years, which will help support production rate ramps across the different Boeing programs.', 'Now let me take you through the details of our third quarter financial results, which I remind you does not reflect any impacts of the recent Boeing MOA.', 'So now lets start on Slide 2.', 'Revenue for the quarter was $1.4 billion, up 13% from the third quarter of 2022.', 'Year-over-year improvement was primarily due to higher production on almost all of our commercial programs as well as increased Defense and Space and Aftermarket revenues.Overall deliveries for the quarter increased 5% year-over-year.', 'The third quarter 2023 revenue was impacted by disruption from the IAM work stoppage in early July and the 737 aft pressure bulkhead issue and continued supply chain and labor challenges, which resulted in less near-term deliveries, specifically on the 737 program.', 'We now expect full year deliveries on the 737 program of approximately 345 to 360 units.Now turning our attention to EPS.', 'We reported earnings per share of negative $1.94 compared to negative $1.22 in the third quarter of 2022.', 'Excluding certain items, adjusted EPS was negative $1.42 compared to negative $0.15 in the prior year.', 'Operating margin was negative 9% compared to breakeven in the same period of 2022, driven by higher changes in estimates and excess capacity costs recognized during the current period.Third quarter forward losses totaled $101 million and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were $64 million.', 'This compared to $49 million of forward losses and $5 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments in the third quarter of 2022.The current quarter forward losses relate primarily to the 787 and A350 programs and were driven by higher estimates of supply chain labor and other related costs.', 'The unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments relate primarily to the 737 and A320 programs, reflecting higher factory costs and rework costs related to the quality issue on the 737 aft pressure bulkhead.Additionally, excess capacity cost during the third quarter of 2023 were $56 million up from $31 million in the same period of 2022.', 'Other income in the third quarter of this year was $7 million, compared to other expense of $42 million in the prior year.', 'The variance was primarily due to noncash pretax charges of $73 million recorded in the third quarter of 2022, driven by the termination of our pension value Plan A as well as lower pension income during the current period.Lets now turn to free cash flow.', 'Free cash flow usage for the quarter was $136 million.', 'Cash usage increased compared to the same period of 2022, largely driven by the negative impacts of working capital and costs associated with factory disruption.Working capital was impacted by the disruption and work stoppage associated with the IAM strike at the beginning of the third quarter, rework and disruption costs related to the 737 aft pressure bulkhead issue as well as ramping to higher production rates on the 737 program.Third quarter 2023 cash from operations also included $50 million customer advance that was previously disclosed and the payment of the ratification bonus related to the IAM contract of $23 million.', 'We have updated our full year free cash flow to reflect the lower 737 deliveries expected for the year and the impacts of the Boeing MOA, and now expect our full year free cash flow to be in the range of negative $275 million to negative $325 million.With that, lets now turn to cash and debt balances on Slide 3.', 'We ended the quarter with $374 million of cash and $3.9 million of debt.', 'Addressing the $1.2 billion of 2025 debt maturities is a near-term priority, and we continue to evaluate all refinancing options to address debt as well as our overall liquidity.Next, lets discuss our segment performance, starting with the Commercial segment on Slide 4.', 'In the third quarter of 2023, commercial revenue increased 10% over the same period of 2022 due to higher production volumes on almost all of our programs.', 'Quarterly operating margin decreased to negative 7% compared to positive 4% in the prior year, driven by higher unfavorable changes in estimates and excess capacity costs recorded in the current period.The changes in estimates during the third quarter, which I previously discussed, included forward losses of $87 million and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $59 million.', 'In comparison, during the third quarter of 2022, the segment recorded charges of $47 million of forward losses and $7 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments.Next, lets turn to the Defense and Space segment on Slide 5.', 'Defense and Space revenue grew to $206 million or 27% higher than the third quarter of last year due to higher development program activity and increased KC-46 tanker production.Operating margin for the quarter decreased to 5% compared to 11% in 2022, primarily due to higher changes in estimates recorded in the current period.', 'The segment recorded forward loss of $15 million and unfavorable cumulative cash adjustments of $5 million compared to forward losses of $2 million and favorable catch-up adjustments of $2 million in the third quarter of 2022.', 'The forward losses were primarily driven by higher production cost estimates on the Sikorsky CH-53K program and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments that were primarily driven by the P-8 program.For our Aftermarket segment results, lets turn to Slide 6.', 'Aftermarket revenues were $97 million, up 21% compared to the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher spare parts sales.', 'Aftermarket continues to grow along with the global air traffic recovery and is on track to meet the plan for the year.', 'Operating margin for the quarter was 19% compared to 24% during the same period of 2022, driven by sales and model mix.With that, well be happy to take your questions.', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.', 'Good morning, everyone, and welcome, Pat.', 'A bunch of questions here.', 'A bunch of questions, but maybe Ill just jump up.', 'I wanted to ask you specifically, Pat, about 2 things that you said in your opening remarks.One is you talked about other cash levers to pull to accelerate.', 'I wonder if you could expand upon that.', 'And you also talked about having the right schedule.', 'And I wonder when we think about 737 production from here, what does the right schedule mean?', 'And whats really -- what are the 2 or 3 things that you think are most important to getting to adequate 737 profitability and not having more of these negative cume adjustments?', 'Lets maybe take the first one.', 'The biggest, as I mentioned, the biggest lever to get to positive free cash flow is program performance.', 'But thats not a pass for the rest of the team to go after indirect costs.', 'And those range from organization structure to enforcement of contracts with our suppliers to a number of the other traditional things you might address in terms of looking at inefficiencies or belt tightening.In addition to that, they are just things we have to stop doing.', 'So in parallel to the other improvement activity, weve really accelerated our focus on every dollar matters, and lets bring it to the bottom line more quickly.Your other question, I think, is really the most important issue that were dealing with right now, and that is the right schedule.', 'And what Ive learned over my almost 40 years in this business, if you get the right schedule, everything else works.The schedule is a barometer for performance.', 'And if youre on schedule, youre going to realize the appropriate costs.', 'And if you get the right costs, youll get the right financial results.When I look at the schedule and hopefully, with the guidance we provided in terms of end of quarter deliveries, we did the math.', 'And the math is, lets adjust for holidays and nonworking days, our effective rate, when you look at deliveries is were at about 37 to 42 a month in the fourth quarter, delivering to Boeing.We have a path to the 50s in 25.', 'And the reason I say we have a path to the 50s is weve been there before.', 'So its not something new.', 'Its a question of how do we stabilize in our internal operations so that without the effort were using today, we can cost effectively with high-quality produce the fuselages that Boeing so desperately needs.The path is through rate increases.', 'The 2 biggest levers for us are the supply chain and our own internal productivity.', 'When you just look at producing 737 fuselages at 42 a month, its roughly 25,000 parts that go into one.', 'And so at 42, thats 1 million parts we need per month.', 'And when you look at the amount of fasteners that we put in, its something on the order of 10 million a month.And so for us to produce, its really about being synchronized and stable.', 'And theres just a lot of detail that goes into achieving that.', 'I believe that well be able to stabilize here and meet Boeings demands in 2024.', 'Id like to walk you through the detailed schedule that were working on.I would just tell you this, is that were not doing things parametrically.', 'Were down to looking at things by the day, by the train pull, by the supplier.', 'Ive been here only a short period of time, but the readiness that we didnt have in the past is not the readiness you will see in 2024.', 'Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.', 'Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu Good morning, guys.', 'And happy Wednesday to you, too, Pat.', 'So I was wondering if you guys could talk about the free cash flow revision, $275 million to $325 million of usage.', 'How are you thinking about the change there from the prior guide?', 'How much of it is tied to the 737?', 'And just as we think about the step-up in Q4, what really changes in first 30 days or so on the job, what have you seen that could be an immediate improvement?', 'Well, Sheila, let me just take the walk on the headwinds and the tailwinds.', 'And then I think Pat can provide some additional color.', 'The biggest impact to free cash flow from a headwind standpoint is fewer 737 deliveries.', 'And I think the challenge that we have here is when we were staffed to 42 airplanes per month, weve been bringing in parts to help support 42 airplanes per month.And when we drop our deliveries from the previous forecast of 370 to 390 to 345 to 360, a lot of that cost is embedded into our system.', 'And so by not delivering the aircraft, were not collecting the cash on the delivery.So I think the impact is a little bit bigger than youve put in your note as it relates to missing the deliveries.', 'The additional forward losses and the negative cume catch-up adjustments that we took is going to add some additional pressure to cash in the fourth quarter.', 'And then were seeing lower A220 deliveries in the fourth quarter, and thats primarily driven by a customer change in their schedule.On the flip side, positiveness from the Boeing MOA, the 787 price increase and the CapEx funding.', 'So I think if you factor all those things in, the biggest impact, I would say, is the lower 737 deliveries and us being staffed and having the working capital in place, and were just not going to release that inventory and collect the cash.', 'Our next question comes from Myles Walton at Wolfe Research.', 'Myles Alexander Walton One quick clarification and then one question for you, Pat.', 'So on the clarification, are you currently shipping to Boeing, conforming fuselages at this point?', 'I realized that you were able to recognize revenue and earnings on sort of nonconforming and then fix after the fact.', 'But if you can update us if youre now conforming.And then, Pat, you made comments about diversification in your opening remarks.', 'And just curious, I know youve been on the Board for a few years, and youve only been on the job for a very short period of time, but is diversification necessary to make Spirit a great company?', 'It had 80% concentration of rev to Boeing just a few years ago.', 'And obviously, the stock did quite nicely, and the revenue and earnings were actually pretty good.', 'So is diversification required?', 'Maybe Ill just take the diversification one first.', 'To the degree that Spirit has approached that in the past, I would say, no.', 'Diversification doesnt make sense at this time.', 'And when you look at the demand for commercial airplanes, having 2 of the biggest customers in the world and not being able to satisfy the demand, it should command our full attention.On maybe the kind of the next level down, weve built a great defense business here, and its a more dangerous world, and I think what you would take away from some of that is we have tremendous engineering capability.And when you think about the future of large-scale aerostructures, its advanced materials.', 'So to that extent, the diversification and probably developing broader capability in advanced materials makes a lot of sense.', 'Aftermarket is -- just isnt of the volume that we see in the other businesses.And to your earlier question, I believe theyre conforming, well make sure to get back to you on our full answer there.', 'The product that were shipping to Boeing at this point in time is being reworked and is conforming.', 'Weve put the fixes in place.', 'So were in good shape there.', 'Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle from Deutsche Bank.', 'Pat, my understanding is that supplier price negotiations with Airbus these days often involve around moving money from one year to another, but that they often fail to address the underlying long-term unit economics for suppliers.', 'But it seems like you need a real structural fix here rather than a band-aid.', 'So Im curious if you think its possible that you get a structural remedy from Airbus.', 'And if not, maybe you can describe what your alternatives might be.', 'Well, I wont describe what the alternatives are because I think we can get a remedy.', 'And I am spending more and more time with my Airbus counterparts.', 'And this is an item of utmost urgency for me personally, and I will be, if not leading, very deep into these conversations and discussions.', 'If you would indulge me for a minute, just kind of talking about composites and advanced materials, just as I mentioned before, really is the future.', 'And when we think about the situation, we have a near-term financial problem.', 'And when I look at the A220 or the C Series, it was produced about the same time as the 787 and the A350.From a technical standpoint, those products are performing extremely well.', 'The maturity of the production system when those designs were certified were really immature, and there are inherent cost limitations.', 'And the performance that we should be realizing out of the manufacturing system just isnt there, but I think its inherently not there.And between us and Airbus, we have to come to some resolution to address that discontinuity.', 'I think well be able to get to the place that makes sense for both parties.', 'But it is a near-term action that Im committed to undertaking, and my counterparts at Airbus feel the same sense of urgency.', 'Our next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein.', 'Douglas Stuart Harned Good morning.', 'When you look at -- Spirit has been dealing with new quality escapes over the last year that have resulted from manufacturing problems that happened well before this year, such as the tail fittings, the aft bulkhead issue, 787 nonconformities.', 'How do you make sure that there are not more issues like these still to come out?', 'And how are you thinking about changing the way you approach quality from an operational standpoint so you can prevent this in the future?', 'Well, Doug, thats probably reading my mind in terms of whats really going to change the reputation and give customers greater confidence is that we really deliver pristine quality products to our customers.', 'Maybe just let me frame it from this standpoint.', 'The tone from the top internally is that my priority is the safety of our teammates, the quality of the product that we build and productivity.', 'Externally, the focus is quality to our customer and on-time, reliable delivery.The mindset I have is that we can be 0 defects.', 'I mean, we can eliminate all defects.', 'We have a very robust quality management system.', 'But every day, we have to put time and attention to that.', 'And it isnt as though theres a silver bullet out there or a different procedure that we can implement.', 'Its the whole organization being first and foremost, focused on how we build the product.', 'And I think youll see that over time because thats where my time will be in, is where you put your time.', 'It gets peoples attention, and leadership has a long shadow.', 'And I think youll see us improve quite a bit in this area.', 'Our next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays.', 'Mark, I think before you guys had talked about getting to free cash flow positive in 2024.', 'Is there anything on the other side of the Boeing MOA as to why that still wouldnt be the case?', 'Thats my first question.And second question, just an update.', 'You mentioned the urgency around the refinancing.', 'What are you looking at in terms of timing to come to market?', 'I think previously, you talked about maybe doing it in 2 phases.', 'Well, good morning David, good to hear from you.', 'As it relates to 2024, I think Pat said, hes 30 days into his role here.', 'Hes making his way through.', 'Were looking at the business holistically and really focused on completing the year, getting the business stabilized and then providing you guys a good, robust update in February.But Ill just kind of reiterate what we said previously.', 'We expect 2024 to be a positive cash flow year.', 'The Boeing MOA is definitely a benefit to 2024 and beyond.', 'And so Ill leave it at that at this point in time.', 'And in February, well come back and give you more specifics around our plans.As it relates to the refinancing, its obviously a big priority for me.', 'The refinancing is a little more than a year out.', 'The goal here is to assess all of our options that we have at this point in time.Weve got some good plans in place were thinking through.', 'Weve been successful as weve gone to the markets in the past.', 'And I think thats -- as Pat talked about, his big goal of working with Airbus, one of my big goals is getting through the refinancing, getting us behind us so we can focus on the business in 2024.And so theres a sense of urgency there.', 'Its a near-term priority.', 'And were going to be working through that, as I had previously stated, to make sure that we get the refinancing done before the debt becomes short term.', 'Our next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.', 'Its been a while, but good to see you back in there.', 'Good morning, George.', 'And Mark, if I look at this quarters free cash flow, I take out the $100 million that youre getting from Boeing.', 'And I dont -- Im not sure whether you got another advance for Airbus.', 'But if you did, I mean, youre still -- next years free cash ought to be a lot better than just looking at this years fourth -- this years implied fourth quarter, which was like $140 million, take out the $100 million from Boeing, so at $40 million.And I dont think there was an Airbus payment there, you can correct me.', 'But why wouldnt next year at least be as good as the annualized rate for this years fourth quarter?', 'Good question, George.', 'I think as I addressed with David, as it relates to free cash flow, again, well stick with the fact that its going to be positive next year.', 'Well provide you more specifics around that when we come back and chat with you in the first week of February when we disclose our results.We dont want to get ahead of things.', 'Pats got a lot of work to do here, and were all here supporting him.', 'Well pull together a good plan, and well provide you guys an update in February.', 'Then one quick one for you, Mark.', 'The higher than expected excess costs, can you give some color with that and kind of what the thinking might be when we get to the fourth quarter?', 'I would just say this, the third quarter was highly disrupted.', 'When you think about our production, the number of units, our position in the factory starting the quarter, not gearing back the production line back up until around, call it, July 10 because of the IAM work stoppage and then the -- or aft bulkhead issue.So I would say, for the most part, its the IAM strike, it was a quality issue and then just some of our own performance in the factory that ultimately added to the excess costs.', 'And so what I would say is its a little bit of an anomaly because of that.', 'And as we move into 2024, I would expect us to continue to see that those excess costs go down as we go up in rate and absorb more of the fixed cost overhead here.', 'So again, I think well continue to see things improve in the fourth quarter and then get better in 24 as compared to 23.', 'Our next question is from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.', 'Good morning, everybody.', 'Pat, is it at least in the scenario analysis that you stay in the CEO seat long term rather than it being an interim solution?', 'Well, Ill tell you, Noah.', 'My commitment to Adrian, my wife and the Board was that I would do this for a year, stand up the operations so that we could put a strong replacement in place, and that remains the commitment, and no change at this time.', 'And then just as a follow-up on the aft pressure bulkhead challenge on the MAX.', 'I heard you that youre now shipping conforming, clean, new off the line.', 'I guess, what about the inventory rework?', 'And just overall, whats the time frame in which that is behind you completely?', 'I dont have a time frame specifically right now in the work that weve been doing.', 'If we had this call another week, I could probably give you a precise answer.', 'The analysis continues to improve.', 'And so I cant really tell you what the final work scope is there, but its trending towards sooner rather than later.', 'Our next question comes from Robert Stallard from Vertical Research.', 'Pat, this is one for you, actually.', 'On the Airbus negotiations, I was wondering if you could give us some idea of how this differs versus the discussions youve been having with Boeing?', 'And in conjunction with Airbus, the A220 program didnt take a charge this quarter.', 'So I was wondering if you could give us an update on how thats going.', 'Maybe Mark can talk about the charge, and I can talk about the negotiations.', 'Do you want to take that first?', 'No forward loss charge in the A220 program.', 'It was a pretty good quarter.', 'I think the team is doing well.', 'Were meeting our delivery commitments to our customer.', 'And so a pretty quiet quarter on the A220 side.', 'Yes, maybe just a comment on the differences or similarities between the Boeing and the Airbus negotiations.', 'Id say theyre very similar.', 'I mean, the nature -- this is really kind of concentrated on the A220.', 'I mean, at the end of the day, its really about the A220.', 'And like my earlier comment about the maturity of the production system and expectations of performance were not aligned.', 'And until we can get that alignment, it makes producing at the higher rates more difficult.And I think that we will come to a reasonable outcome because its important for -- its important for Airbus.', 'Its important for Spirit.', 'Its important for the airplane.', 'There is strong demand for that airplane.', 'And were committed to Airbus, and I think theyre committed to us, and its just something here in the short term.', 'But Im encouraged, based on the Boeing agreement, that well get there with Airbus.', 'And just a quick follow-up, Pat.', 'Hard to put a time frame on this.', 'Do you think youll get this done before February?', 'Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn from Melius Research.', '[Scott Mikus] on for Rob Spingarn.', 'Pat, I did want to ask you, if you pursue a financial remedy on the A220 or A350, is there any concern that Spirit could potentially see a reduced role later on A220 or A320neo if Airbus rewings those programs?', 'I mean, I spend half my time on that question and half my time on the negotiating.', 'Not as much of the negotiating strategy with the strategy process.', 'And I think with our advanced engineering capability and the things that we do with resin transfer molding, were a critical part.', 'Its not so much the wing of tomorrow.', 'Its just Airbus long-term composite supply chain, I think were a vital piece of that.', 'The issue we have is just here in the near term, how do we solve this financial disconnect?', 'But I would bet on the team in Belfast to be a critical part of Airbus future.We just have the overhang of some agreements that go back a long time pre-COVID that we have to kind of work our way through.', 'But as the earlier remark I made about this company in advanced materials, the things that were doing are really going to be the basis of the next generation of product out there on the defense world and commercially because we can do it at scale and we get reps every single day.And to go replicate some of these assets in a greenfield at scale is cost-prohibitive.', 'So I think its just you get trapped in these situations of managing quarter-to-quarter or that somebody should get better performance than theyre actually realizing.', 'And I think just like with the Boeing agreement, were going to get to a place that makes sense for both parties.', 'Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen.', 'So the Boeing MOA basically, you basically get some -- have to take a lower price on the 737 as you get out to 26.', 'And you get a much higher price on the 787 near term.', 'But then around the middle of 2008, you have the renegotiation of the price on the 787.', 'And I mean, as I read what Ive read of the MOA, it looks like basically barring any change in the negotiation, that the 787 price at that point goes back to where it currently is or relatively close.Is that your read or so -- how should I be concerned that thats a real liability or as you get out there that the 87 could revert to going back into modest, basically breakeven or a loss?', 'Let me jump in there.', 'I would say that we came to a good conclusion on the appropriate pricing on the 787 program, essentially out through the order book.', 'We have a commitment between the 2 parties to negotiate a fair and reasonable price beyond 1605, one year in advance of that delivery date.', 'And just like we came to an appropriate conclusion, which allows Spirit to make an appropriate margin on that airplane program here shortly.', 'Thats what our expectations will be long term.', 'And if I may, one more on the Airbus talks, clearly, its going to be difficult to do a refi unless that is behind you.', 'Does that -- do you feel that puts increased pressure on you to kind of come to the table more quickly?', 'Or how do you deal with that timing issue of having to get that done before a refi?', 'Cai, I dont think were in a position where were pressured to negotiate.', 'I mean, Mark, you might comment just on the financial situation, but I think we have time to get it right, but theres no point in wasting time.', 'No, I agree with Pat.', 'Id just say this, Cai, I think the Boeing MOA provides a nice boost to liquidity here over the next several years.', 'And I think we have some momentum here on that front.', 'And so again, when it comes to the refinancing, were going to do whats best for us, for our company and for our shareholders.', 'And work through that accordingly.', 'And as Pat said, no pressure on the Airbus side.', 'That will happen in its due course.', 'Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons at UBS.', 'Pat, you suggested youll be delivering, I think, around 37 to 42 a month in the fourth quarter.', 'Just to clarify, is your plan still that youll be cycling and delivering at 42, starting in 2024?', 'Or is there a spread?', 'And then could you update us on the current MAX inventory buffer?', 'And in terms of the buffer, I dont have... Weve got, as you know, a mix of units in there.', 'So we -- Gavin, we have about 80 units in buffer.', 'We like to categorize them in 2 components.', 'Units that are on hold and then units that are available to ship.', 'So theres around 50 units that have -- that are in Boeings -- in the buffer, Boeing owns title to those, and Boeing can pull them whenever theyre ready to pull.So buffers increased a bit.', 'At the end of the second quarter, it was low as we prepared for the work stoppage issue, but weve been able to build up that buffer to a certain degree.', 'And as Pat said, the goal here is as we move forward here to sync up our production schedules.', 'But thats an update on the buffer.', 'Our next question comes from Peter Arment from Baird.', 'The $100 million youre getting for tooling-related equipment for the 737 and 787, can you kind of give us a little more color of what the real benefit is there?', 'I mean, obviously, its nice to see the cash infusion.', 'But as Pat you said, youve been at these higher rates before.', 'So what is actually the benefit that youre seeing here?', 'Number one, with most OEMs, if you have production rate increases or model mix or new derivatives, the OEMs always own the tooling, right?', 'And so thats unchanged from our previous agreements.', 'But in this current environment, when we look at the model mixes -- and we have the Dash-7s, the 8s, the 9s and the 10s, Boeing is selling more 7s, more 10s, and that has an impact on our production system.', 'And so therefore, its going to require us to make some capital investment.', 'And so one of the benefits of the agreement, we appreciate this from Boeing is theyre going to pay for some capital that normally Spirit would have to pay.And normally, what would happen is as we built those units, wed absorb more overhead and that would help profitability.', 'But the big benefit here is its a combination of tooling and capital that Boeing is going to pay for.', 'Theyve given us an advance in the fourth quarter and some funding in 24 and a little bit in 25, and thats going to result in us spending higher CapEx in 24 and 25 to reflect the new models and the adjustments we need to make in the production system.So there is a benefit to Spirit.', 'Its going to be a little lumpy when the receipts come in and when the funds go out.', 'But we think our Boeing customer, theyre making the actual capital investment themselves.', 'And so we appreciate that.', 'So really, thats in a nutshell.', 'Its a nice little benefit, although its cash neutral, it is a benefit to Spirit.', 'Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli from Truist.', 'Michael Frank Ciarmoli Pat or Mark, just on the MOA, can you maybe help us out or give us a little bit more detail?', 'Obviously, you kind of cotriangulate where the 787 deliveries are going to be this year.', 'You got the $60 million revenue increase.', 'I mean, was that all pricing?', 'And should we assume thats kind of maybe rough $2 million per unit pricing?And then you kind of said not going to be margin positive for 25.', 'I guess the reversal of the amortization looks to be an additive, but I think youre still paying back from the existing MOU, the 450,000.', 'Can you just help us bridge some of those moving pieces so we can get a better expectation on 787?', 'Im not going to comment specifically on what the price increase is per unit.', 'But I think the -- what you should take from the agreement is were reversing forward losses where previously in the future, our cost was higher than our price.', 'So when you reduce a forward loss, right, and the cost forecast is unchanged, its a pricing benefit.', 'So those losses or those cash losses that we would book in the future, were reversing those because those no longer exist.And then when we talk about when we get to positive margins on that program, were at 4, 5 a month, moving to 7 a month.', 'So its going to take us a little time to absorb some of that overhead and get the full benefits of the pricing agreement.', 'And so when we look at the early part of 2025, were going to be at a higher rate than we are right now.And based on the price were getting paid per unit and what our cost projections are, we talked about being positive margins, and we expect that to be a benefit on an ongoing basis.So again, I dont want to get into specifics about how much we got paid, but its a big, big deal to Spirit.', 'Were at the point now where we were in a loss position since essentially the inception of the program.And here in short order, our cash and the revenue will be higher than our cost, and it will be a cash positive program for us.', 'And so a good thing for us as that program starts to go up and right here over the next 12 to 18 months.', 'Our last question today comes from Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley.', 'Pat and Mark, the MOA with Boeing clearly signaled to Spirit equity and bondholders your strategic importance to Boeing.', 'I mean that said, operations continue to get worse with the forward losses and the negative cumulative catch-ups, even in defense.', 'So from your conversations with Boeing, to what degree does Boeings financial support extend?', 'And can Boeing step in to explicitly help underwrite the refinancing of the 2025 maturities?', 'Good morning, Kristine.', 'An interesting question.', 'And we do thank our big customer for the agreement that we have in place, and we think its -- they deemed it as a win-win.', 'I wouldnt view it as charity.', 'I think we perform a great service to our customers.', 'I think we do a great job performing on their programs.', 'And so overall, its -- they describe it as a win-win.', 'And we view it as a win-win.As it relates to refinancing strategies, as Ive said before, we have access to the capital markets.', 'We dont need Boeing to underwrite us as we think about our strategies around upcoming maturities.', 'And I would just kind of leave it at that.', 'And if I could do a follow-up.', 'When we factor in the current inflation environment, the higher labor costs, in the pricing step down for the 737 come 2026, what should margins for the program be for the 737 at that point?', 'And how would that compare to where we were around the 2019 levels?', 'Hey Kristine, Id just say this, hey, before we jump to 2026, let us get through 2023 and have a good, robust discussion with you in February about 2024.', 'Well have those discussions in good time.', 'This concludes todays conference call.', 'Thank you all very much for dialing in, and have a wonderful day.']",['Q3 2023 Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc Earnings Call'],['Q3 2023 Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc Earnings Call'],"['Mark J.

Group MD  Senior Analyst Wolfe Research, LLC Good morning, and thank you for standing by.', 'Welcome to the Q3 2023 Allegiant Travel Company Earnings Conference Call.', 'At this time, all participants are in listen mode.', 'After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.', '(Operator Instructions).', 'Please be advised that todays conference is being recorded.', 'I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Sherry Wilson.', 'Welcome to the Allegiant Travel Companys Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call.', 'On the call with me today are Maurice Gallagher, the companys Executive Chairman and CEO Greg Anderson, President Scott DeAngelo, our EVP and Chief Marketing Officer Drew Wells, our SVP and Chief Revenue Officer Robert Neal, SVP and Chief Financial Officer and a handful of others to help answer questions.', 'We will start the call with commentary and then open it up to questions.', 'We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.', 'The companys comments today will contain forward-looking statements concerning our future performance and strategic plans.', 'Various risk factors could cause the underlying assumptions of these statements and our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements.', 'These risk factors and others are more fully disclosed in our filings with the SEC.', 'Any forward-looking statements are based on information available to us today.', 'We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of future events, new information or otherwise.', 'The company cautions investors not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which may be based on assumptions and events that do not materialize.', 'To view this earnings release as well as the rebroadcast of the call, feel free to visit the companys Investor Relations site at ir.allegiantair.com.', 'And with that, Ill turn it to Maurice.', 'Thank you, Sherry, and well, hello again.', 'Some of you may recognize my voice.', 'I hope youve all been well over the past 1.5 years, its good to be back.', 'As you saw in our release, Allegiant Airlines generated an operating profit in Q3 after adjustments, our 11th quarter in a row of airline operating profits beginning in Q1 of 21.', 'Our year-to-date 2023, 13% airline operating margin leads the industry for those that have reported.', 'And we have achieved these results while continuing to invest for the future.', 'During the past quarter, weve installed two substantial management systems, SAP and Navitaire, both are operating as I write this.', 'As you saw at the top of our release, Sunseeker will open December 15.', 'Its been a 5-year effort almost 3 years longer than planned, but the wait will be worth it.', 'Micah Richins, our Sunseeker President and his cohorts, Jason Garoupa and Paul Barry, all MGM Las Vegas veterans are putting the final touches on this magnificent project.', 'The critical reason I endorsed Sunseeker was the quality of this management group.', 'Our ability to attract these gentlemen to convince them to work for a startup, move their families to Florida, speaks volumes of their belief in this project.', 'And Micah is here with us today, Im happy to announce to answer any questions.', 'Our first MAX 8200 is scheduled for delivery in early 2024.', 'Our MAX fleet will have a premium seating of just over 50 of our 190 seats, and well improve our economics in the coming years.', 'Besides the benefits from the quality and number of seats that will have a substantially improved fuel burn compared to the Airbus, improved reliability, a maintenance honeymoon while maintaining a comparable Airbus ownership expense.', 'Were excited about onboarding the MAX in coming years and beyond.', 'During the past few months, there have been discussions concerning a structural shift in our industry, particularly as it pertains to the ULCCs.', 'We started and frontier invented this industry segment during the past 20 years, focusing on low cost and high growth for our leisure customers.', 'Theres been and still are differences between our business model and the [Frankie] centric model.', 'At the end of the day, you judge us on our profitability.', 'Costs are a part of the equation, but having the lowest cost does not guarantee success.', 'We at Allegiant have a flexible model focused on flying when the customers want to fly.', 'Or said differently, we minimize our flying in off-peak periods and peak up for the peak periods.', 'That has been our model for over 20 years.', 'In addition, our direct-to-customer sales approach is less expensive and allows us to capture important customer information.', 'I might add, we have over 18 million names in our customer database at this point.', 'It also allows us to capture more of Allegiant customers wallet with our third-party revenue program.', 'During the past 5 years, we have prioritized enhancing our brand as well.', 'These efforts include adding Allegiant Stadium, our soon to be opened Sunseeker Resort, our best-in-show completion percentage and our 1 rank credit card program.', 'All are difference makers.', 'These investments have allowed us to maintain unit revenues that have been consistently higher than the high utilization ULCCs today, as much as 40% higher.', 'As we all know, revenue production is the issue of the day.', 'Our revenue production is one of the critical differences that separates us from the ULCC crowd.', 'Our network structure is also different.', 'We have operated an out-and-back schedule since our earliest days.', 'Its much simpler to manage than the traditional hub and spoke.', 'Each route stands alone, we monitor what we believe its capacity should be enhance its profitability.', 'We are diligent in managing individual route earnings.', 'We have had a 22-year history of consistent profits and growth with this scheduling approach, industry-leading profits I might add.', 'Additionally, with our focus on smaller cities to sun and fun destinations, weve been able to own the majority of our markets.', '75% of our routes have no direct competition.', 'As I said, we own these markets.', 'This contrasts with the 90% overlap to high utilization ULCCs have in their networks.', 'Lastly, we have identified as many as 1,400 new domestic routes that we could add in the coming years, plus the addition of our international partnership with Viva.', 'More subtle difference has been the pace of growth.', 'During our 22 years, weve grown to 127 aircraft to an average of 5.7 per year.', 'Others in this space have grown at a much faster pace to date, adding aircraft almost 3x faster per year than we have.', 'Still others have planned deliveries in the coming years that have double-digit yearly adds with a 3 handle, if you do the math.', 'Fast growth while attractive to the audience on the phone here creates potential operational problems, including a concentrated fleet of the same aircraft type, which has historically been desired, but today has become a burden with the [Pratt other] problem, operational size and complexity that most likely outpaces management experience.', 'And lastly, a pronounced competitive response given the network overlap with the larger incumbent carriers.', 'We are built for the long haul for consistency.', 'We have a great future.', 'I understand theres a new label as well for ULCC circulating LMAs or low-margin airlines.', 'That description does not define our (inaudible) fitter model.', 'At this time, given the name seems to be no given new names, Im proposing a new label for us, no more ULCC and certainly no LMA.', 'Our new label is PLFC, profitable leisure-focused carrier.', 'Thats what we are to be called from now on.', 'We are in a class of our own.', 'Lastly, let me thank our team members.', 'Theres been a difficult 3 to 4 years.', 'They have been supporting our passengers with safe, reliable and friendly service during this time.', 'They have run the best airline this year, an industry-leading 99.8% completion factor.', 'In todays era of poor service and cancelled flights, they have put us back where we belong at the top of the pack.', 'Gregory Clark Anderson Maury, thank you.', 'Great to have you back.', 'As we experience broader macro uncertainty around geopolitical risk, inflation and high interest rates, there also appear to be signs of structural changes happening in our industry.', 'In the face of these uncertainties, Allegiant is uniquely set up to continue to reshape the leisure travel sector.', 'We have been strengthening our foundation to do just that.', 'Operational excellence underpins everything we do and our year-to-date controllable completion of 99.8% demonstrates that, also resulting in a staggering reduction of nearly $100 million or 75% in total IROP costs year-over-year.', 'Our disciplined approach to costs and particularly our variable cost model gives us a competitive advantage as we adjust capacity to the environment.', 'Whether day of week, month of year or route by route, our planning teams are expertly matching capacity with leisure demand.', 'As leisure demand seasonality has more normalized, we are working towards a measured approach to take utilization higher during the peak demand periods or in other words, peak the peaks.', 'For instance, average aircraft utilization was seven hours during this past summer, increasing that by one hour would drive roughly $50 million more in earnings.', 'The composition of our mix fleet balanced with both low per seat and low per trip costs will further benefit us by deploying the right gauge aircraft in the right markets at the right time.', 'Our 737 MAX aircraft will strengthen our fleet flexibility.', 'Its nearly 20% fuel burn advantage, yet similar ownership cost profile translates into incremental earnings power of more than 2 million more per Max aircraft when compared to our existing fleet.', 'Furthermore, we are excited to expand premium sittings for our customers.', 'Every MAX aircraft delivered will enter into service in the Allegiant extra configuration while the retrofit of the in-service A320 has already begun and will complete over time.', 'Our Allegiant Extra product continues to deliver as it is in high demand with our customers and driving meaningful value.', 'During 2023, we expect to fly nearly 18 million customers.', 'Notably, we were the most convenient and only nonstop option available on approximately 75% of the routes from the communities we serve.', 'Our direct distribution strategy, coupled with our continued ascension of our brand is unlocking deep and long-standing relationships with our customers.', 'On an annual basis, nearly 2/3 of our customers are repeating their experience with us, 12 million of whom are members of our award-winning Allways rewards, fueling the amazing growth of our aspirational loyalty program that Scott will discuss momentarily.', 'Our continued investments in technological upgrades to our foundational systems such as SAP, Navitaire, Trax and NAVBLUE, not only optimize scale and provide new capabilities, they also free up development resources for strategic differentiated products to drive more revenue or reduce costs.', 'Furthermore, Navitaire will unlock international expansion for us into coveted beach destinations in Mexico, alongside our joint venture partner, Viva Aerobus, once we can secure the necessary government approvals.', 'Each of these initiatives mentioned have or should provide significant long-term benefits for the company.', 'However, none have near as creative impact as Team Allegiant.', 'As we listen and learn from our team members across the system, I am constantly energized by their commitment and their passion.', 'They are dedicated to taking care of our customers and each other.', 'And while earlier this year, we ratified and extended two of our four labor agreements, we still have two to go, one with flight attendants and one with pilots.', 'I want to reiterate managements commitment to getting agreements in place that our flight crews will be proud to support.', 'What Team Allegiant has accomplished this year is truly remarkable.', 'While today, our broad footprint serves 125 cities with over 550 routes throughout the United States, we are positioning to grow our airline profitably as the environment allows.', 'Allegiants business model and the role we play in the communities we serve has netted us into the fabric of the nations leisure travel industry.', 'We have identified 1,400 plus incremental routes that fit beautifully into the Allegiant network.', 'As we expand in those markets, we further solidify the important and necessary part we play in the travel industry throughout the U.S. And in closing, I want to extend my sincere thanks to all of our team members.', 'Together, we are running a great airline.', 'Together, we have meaningfully strengthened our foundation and together, Team Allegiant has proven to be unstoppable.', 'Third quarter saw a continued post-pandemic normalization of domestic leisure travel demand.', 'We saw peak demand levels during July when we top bookings and load factor versus last years historic highs, we saw slight demand decline during August versus prior year as back to school, came mid-month for many of the cities we serve and summer vacation season came to an end.', 'And we saw further modest demand decline in September versus prior year as we officially entered the off-peak leisure travel season.', 'As you all know, our business model has always focused on the domestic leisure traveler and these peak versus off-peak ebbs and flows in domestic leisure travel demand regularly existed before the pandemic and a year removed from unprecedented levels of pent-up revenge travel demand in 2022, the same familiar ebbs and flows have returned this year.', 'That said, there are two areas of potential domestic leisure travel demand headwinds that are being talked about a lot in the industry and that Id like to address based on what were seeing and hearing from our customers at Allegiant.', 'The first is the economy.', 'We conduct a weekly customer sentiment tracking survey where we ask our customers how they feel about the state of the economy.', 'At the beginning of the third quarter, about 50% said they felt the economy was getting somewhat or much worse.', 'In the past several weeks, that number has grown to nearly 70%.', 'However, during that same time span as captured within the same survey, the portion of customers saying they intend to book air travel in the next 90 days has remained virtually unchanged.', 'We believe this seeming contradiction can be easily explained by the majority of our customers who say they are traveling to visit friends or family as well as by the material portion of our customers who say they are traveling between a primary residence and a second vacation home.', 'As weve stated in the past, its been our experience that these remain the most reliable and resilient forms of leisure travel during economic downturns.', 'The second area is international travel.', 'For the past quarter, weve also surveyed our customers weekly on this topic.', 'Consistently, up to 20% of our customers do say that they either had traveled or planning to travel abroad this year.', 'However, the vast majority of those nearly 90% said that their international travel is in addition to not in substitution of their domestic leisure travel plans.', 'While these observations may be different than what other airlines are seeing or saying, it likely speaks to Allegiants differentiated low-utilization business model with a focus on selling our all-nonstop route network direct to consumers under a surging brand and winning loyalty programs that are unique and their ability to engage and reward the domestic leisure traveler.', 'Speaking of our loyalty programs, our most lot and engage segment within the Allways Rewards program is, of course, our co-brand credit card holders.', 'Third quarter year-to-date, these cardholders have exhibited 11% greater spend on the card on a per cardholder basis versus last year.', 'In addition, our co-brand cardholders continue to exhibit strong travel frequency and spend with net revenue burped up 10% versus prior year.', 'Through third quarter, total co-brand credit card program compensation has been $88 million, which is 14% higher than last year and puts us well on our way to surpassing $100 million in total program compensation for the full year.', 'Our Allways Rewards noncredit card program also continues to show strong positive impact on customer behavior.', 'Third quarter year-to-date, nearly 13 million Allways Rewards member passenger segments have been booked, that 17% more than last year and for the same time period, spend per member is about 5% greater than last year.', 'Finally, as Maurice mentioned, completion of enterprise-wide systems implementations that provide a modern technology foundation for all areas of our business will free up technology development capacity for smaller, but nonetheless critical strategic enhancements to our website, mobile app and loyalty programs, helping us supercharge our ability to drive greater revenue outside the aircraft and high-margin third-party products and loyalty program partnerships.', 'We believe that these enhancements enable us to further differentiate Allegiant and further diversify the ways we drive revenue.', 'And with that, Ill turn it over to our Chief Revenue Officer, Drew Wells.', 'Thank you, Scott, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning.', 'Im extremely pleased with the record third quarter performance of $565 million in total revenue, growth of nearly 1% on system ASM reduction of 0.4%.', 'This combination produced a TRASM of $0.128, which vested any previous third quarter and grew year-over-year by 1.4%.', 'Our commitment to matching capacity and demand set us up for success in the third quarter with nearly 45% of our scheduled ASMs coming in July and in September having just more than half of Julys flying.', 'However, we are still meaningfully constrained in the best demand periods, limiting our ability to truly match with appropriate capacity.', 'Despite the relatively out weighted July level of flying, our utilization was almost 2.5 hours per aircraft per day lower than 2019, lower than any year since 2015 when MD-80s grew over 60% of our ASMs.', 'We have proven the ability to achieve peak flying.', 'And as we will always schedule peak periods to the first operational constraint, either aircraft or crew, expect to restore utilization alongside the relief of those constraints.', 'As we continue to learn what the new normal means for the travel industry, one component of pre-pandemic travel has firmly returned, the gap between peak and off-peak performance.', 'By way of example, Saturdays and post Labor Day, September 2023 were approximately 30% worse than July Saturdays in terms of unit revenue and in line with 2019s peak to trough variants.', 'Last year, that figure was just 15% worse.', 'And as one would expect, the combination of outperforming off-peak periods in late 2022 and current year demand normalizing creates a tough environment for year-over-year figures.', 'This makes me even prouder of the results we generated.', 'A significant part of this was continued success of our air ancillary products, which grew approximately 10% on a per passenger basis year-over-year.', 'First and foremost, our learning and experimenting with bundled ancillaries continue to show incredible strides.', 'Additionally, Allegiant extra contribution on a per flight basis has improved year-over-year in every quarter despite increasing the number of configured aircraft.', 'We will end the year with roughly 11% of the fleet configured for Legion Extra and expect that to grow to nearly 30% of the year-end 2024 fleet.', 'Underscoring both in air ancillary at large are the expected improvements of Navitaire.', 'One of the ramifications of specific use case internal development is some mismatch of existing capabilities for the off-the-shelf product.', 'I truly believe this is a significant signal of strength for our internal capabilities that will become supercharged in the future state.', 'So while we still have immense confidence in the upside to come with Navitaire, we actually expect to see some slight headwinds into the fourth quarter due to a short-term small loss of functionality.', 'I believe its worth reminding that the entire leisure demand ecosystem remains well above pre-pandemic levels, with July roughly flat with 2022 and high teen percent above 2019.', 'In fact, among carriers reporting thus far, Allegiant is the only carrier of double digits in both capacity and unit revenue year-over-year, both in the third quarter and year-to-date through the third quarter.', 'We are also seeing some normalcy as we shift into 4Q and expect a TRASM reasonably in line with pre-pandemic historic median sequential change, while certainly off from the extraordinary 4Q 22 comp, it should still produce a better 4Q TRASM than any pre-pandemic fourth quarter and the last 9 months 2023 TRASM higher than the last 9 months 2022.', 'Additionally, there is some growth through the fourth quarter, around 5%.', 'This should put full year scheduled service capacity up approximately 1.5% versus full year 2022, while system capacity should be approximately plus 1.8%.', 'The growth in the quarter is focused in 2 areas: weeks with large forecasted cost per gallon decline like in October and holiday weeks, which will extend into early January 2024 as well.', 'As I mentioned, even with the growth, holiday flying will still be lower than we can ultimately desire.', 'However, we believe we struck the right balance of profitability potential and operations within the limitations present, particularly after 2022s weather impacted holiday operations across the industry.', 'Further, we are treading carefully with capacity in early 2024, with so many moving parts, Boeing deliveries, crew polls for transition training and persistent elevated fuel among others.', 'I expect the first half of the year to be fairly flat with a full year target of up mid-single digits.', 'The holiday weeks as with all peaks have shown incredible resilience.', 'Even Labor Day in September was a record.', 'I maintain high expectations for holiday performance, while expecting normal leisure softness around them.', 'And with that, Id like to turn it over to Robert.', 'Thanks, Drew, and good morning, everyone.', 'This morning, we reported our third quarter 2023 financial results, which included an adjusted consolidated net income of $2.7 million and an adjusted earnings per share of $0.09.', 'Included in that number is approximately $6 million in costs related to resort operations ahead of opening our Sunseeker property later this year.', 'Adjusted net income for the airline was $7.9 million, yielding an adjusted airline earnings per share of $0.31.', 'Total operating revenue during the quarter was $565 million, up approximately 1% over the same quarter last year and the highest of any third quarter in our history.', 'This was on a slight capacity reduction of 0.8%, resulting in TRASM of $0.1278, which was 1.4% higher as compared to the same quarter last year.', 'Fuel costs increased sharply beginning mid-August driving a September cost per gallon 27.5% above July.', 'This brought our third quarter cost per gallon to $3.09, 15% above the prior quarter and brings our estimated full year cost per gallon to $3.12, an increase of $0.22 from the prior guide of $2.90.', 'Adjusted nonfuel unit costs were just under $0.085, which was an increase of 9.5% over the third quarter of 2022.', 'Our nonfuel unit cost increase was driven by approximately 7 points in wage increases for frontline employees, inclusive of our pilot payroll accrual, which was in place for all three months during the quarter.', 'Other drivers of the unit cost increase were 1.7 points from lower asset utilization and approximately 0.5 point related to inflationary cost in aircraft maintenance and stations and the rest from a handful of other items.', 'Assuming an estimated fuel cost of $3.12 per gallon for the full year, we are expecting an adjusted airline earnings per share of approximately $8.15 at the midpoint, down from $11.75 at the midpoint of prior guidance.', 'Fuel costs drive a reduction of $2.40 per share and the reduced off-peak revenue makes up most of the remaining $1.20.', 'As Maury noted, opening of Sunseeker has shifted by about 2 months.', 'And as a result, we are now expecting only about 2 weeks of revenue production during the year, which would take our full year Sunseeker guidance to a loss per share of $1.75 as compared to our prior estimate of $1.20.', 'Although Im pleased to see significant improvement over -- in 2023 over the prior year with respect to financial performance, we still have work to do to return to sustained industry-leading margins.', 'With the introduction of a new fleet type alongside a volatile fuel environment and the normalization of leisure demand patterns, we expect to take a conservative and measured approach to growth during next year.', 'Weve made significant investments in the business this year, and we remain confident these investments will deliver expanding margins in the coming years.', 'On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with net debt of $1.3 billion and just under $1.3 billion in available liquidity, which included $1 billion in cash and investments and $280 million in undrawn revolvers.', 'In addition, we are pleased to have more than $400 million in committed financing for upcoming aircraft deliveries and predelivery deposits.', 'We refinanced seven A320 aircraft during the quarter and used proceeds towards this mornings prepayment of a $150 million bond, which was scheduled to mature in 2024.', 'With committed financing covering the vast majority of our CapEx obligations up to the second quarter of next year and our largest 24 maturity now repaid, we expect to maintain liquidity at the greater of 2x our air traffic liability or $850 million at year-end.', 'Third quarter airline capital expenditures were $157.6 million, which included $112 million in aircraft inductions and predelivery deposits, $45.5 million in other airline CapEx and deferred heavy maintenance spend of $14 million.', 'Capital expenditures related to Sunseeker were $71.6 million.', 'Our guidance today reduces our full year 2023 estimated airline CapEx, excluding heavy maintenance, to approximately $590 million, largely due to the timing of aircraft deliveries shifting some of this spend into 2024 and 25.', 'Turning to fleet, we inducted one A320 aircraft during the quarter, which was owned and on property at the end of the second quarter.', 'We expect two additional A320 purchases during the fourth quarter before we begin taking deliveries of our 737 MAX order book in early 2024.', 'During the quarter, we reached agreement with Boeing on an amendment to our order for 5737 MAX aircraft whereby the firm aircraft are now scheduled to deliver through the fourth quarter of 2025.', 'Weve converted six of our MAX 7 positions to the MAX A200 variant, and were pleased to now have 80 options in our MAX order book, securing opportunities for fleet growth through 2029 and providing tremendous flexibility, allowing us to evaluate the results of a new fleet type in our business prior to making further commitments.', 'Im pleased with our year-to-date financial performance, yielding an adjusted airline operating margin of roughly 13%, notwithstanding the continued heightened fuel.', 'Our low utilization model sets us up nicely to expertly deploy capacity to meet seasonal demand trends, and we will enhance this with the introduction of more efficient aircraft next year.', 'By the time of our next earnings call, we expect to have opened Sunseeker, taking delivery of our first MAX aircraft and starting to see the benefits of Navitaire and the systems investments weve made in 2023.', 'Certainly, were not out of the woods on execution risk yet, but we are excited about the positive momentum we have on these initiatives heading into 2024.', 'Thank you, Lisa, and we can now begin taking analyst questions.', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question today will be coming from Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank.', 'Hi everyone, this is actually Shannon Doherty on for Mike.', 'Maury, congratulations and welcome back.', 'If I may, you guys first half results were much better than the second half.', 'It was actually quite a meaningful deceleration in earnings into the second half.', 'So how does that impact your decision-making for 2024 when you think about capacity, which markets to serve fleet planning, if you can give us anything -- any more color here, that would be helpful.', 'Gregory Clark Anderson Shannon, this is Greg.', 'Why dont I kick it off.', 'There are some components in the first half of the year.', 'Obviously, demand strength in the off-peak fuel that helped fuel that the higher profitability versus the second half of the year.', 'But as we think about 24, were not coming out and to give a guide this year, but I think Vijay hit on it really nicely in his remarks where we should think about 24 of unlocking a lot of the benefits and the investments that weve made.', 'First and foremost, from my perspective, we want to continue to work hard and get labor deals complete for our flight crews.', 'Thats a key component, systems.', 'Both Maury and I alluded to this as its Scott DeAngelo in our opening remarks, that weve made massive investments in new kind of next generational type systems.', 'And when I say investments, I mean, these are hundreds of thousands of man hours that weve been putting in on each one of these systems, SAP, Trax.', 'Weve cut those two over.', 'We have two more to go.And what were going to do with those systems now is were going to get better.', 'Were going to learn how to use them properly.', 'Were going to become more efficient we can scale better.', 'So thats an important element as well.', 'Obviously Sunseeker opening, bringing on the Boeing aircraft.', 'So theres just been a lot of investments in the business that I think truly, believe will strengthen us.', 'The one thing I want to say is you think about capacity next year and balancing that with the environment and the normalization that weve seen, its how do we get back to peak in those peaks.', 'And weve been constrained for various reasons, whether that be the broader ecosystem, ATC, whether that be labor.', 'But really, if you think about 2023 and if you remember a year ago, when we talked about entering 2023, we said we needed to level set operations.', 'We need to make sure we ran an integrity -- operational excellence and integrity, and weve done that.', 'And now its how do we balance and build that back.', 'And as we think about peaking the peaks, Im not sure if Drew or anyone wants to add any commentary there for next year or anything else on 24.', 'I hit on this a little bit in my remarks, but the peaks are subject to any operational constraint all of the time, right?', 'And right now, its a bit more constraining than typical.', 'We earn a significant amount of our annual earnings through those periods.', 'There will come a time that we get some relief on those constraints and then we will be able to peak.', 'Weve been kept relatively similar in terms of departures per peak day in the summer for the last several years, which is not something weve experienced in the past.', 'Beyond that, weve taken a lot of strides to maintain operational integrity and we kind of throw a lot of things at that.', 'And now we can start to claw those back in a meaningful way, we start to understand how each of those components build up to the whole.', 'So I think what youre seeing is something thats on the more conservative side relative to what weve thrown out before.', 'Weve proven that we can do peak close to 10 hours a day, and then I have every bit of confidence well get back there.', 'Well, one other comment.', 'The third quarter is always our weakest quarter.', 'And what weve got going on now is our fourth quarter just hasnt shown up because weve got a resetting of going back to traditional network types of things, and people are trying to get back into a form factor that theyre used to.', 'And so Drew and Gregs point, we need to now -- 24 will be the first time, I think, when we can really look and reinstitute the 2019 model that we so well ran back then.', 'And that we may not be hitting on all similars in 24, but well be well on our way through our typical very good first quarter, very good second quarter, third quarter breakeven week, fourth quarter start getting ready for the next year and do the same thing.', 'And did I hear you guys correctly that we should think first quarter capacity somewhat flat and still targeting mid-single digits next year capacity for the full year?', 'Generally, yes, first half of the year, probably roughly flat with mid-singles but full year target.', 'And if I can squeeze one more in really quickly.', 'Greg, and you guys thank you for all the remarks on utilization, but I was intrigued by the 1-hour increase in utilization that could have possibly increased profits by $50 million.', 'If you were to just pinpoint what is limiting you the most right now on increasing your aircraft regulation?', 'I know you guys listed a bunch of things like ETC labor.', 'Where is the biggest pain point currently?', 'Gregory Clark Anderson No, thanks for the question, Shannon.', 'And that would be just in the summer period.', 'So if you think about it on a full year, the summers are -- so longest peak period.', 'But if you add March and you end the winter of the holidays, its probably more like $100 million in total, if youre able to take an hour up to utilization.', 'Id say it just depends on the stuff on the as we were more aircraft constrained.', 'In the summer, its been more labor constraints, but also trying to balance what were seeing with some of the disruptions around airports or ATC.', 'But kind of underpinning all of this, Shannon, though, is operational integrity, and we capped our peak period flying this year before we even enter it.', 'We just said we wont do any more than this, roughly 7 hours per day until we build it back.', 'And I might just add real quick, thats the biggest component to peaking the peaks, we probably launched between 0.5 hour an hour of utilization simply with elevated fuel and the kind of the demand versus fuel bake-off that happened in off-peak periods.', 'But theres still value to be had in off peaks despite all of this, but its much harder to find at $3.50 a gallon than it is at $2.15, kind of where we were in 2019.', 'Our next question will be coming from Savanthi Prelis of Raymond James.', 'Savanthi Nipunika Prelis-Syth Could I ask you about your 2024 fleet plan.', 'Boeing, you said two more Airbus and then kind of is it the rest just Boeing then and hopefully, youll get two a month?', 'For 2024, we are currently -- we are contracted to take delivery of two airplanes per month throughout 2024.', 'As you know, and I think youre alluding to, theres a lot of moving parts there.', 'So were staying close to Boeing on that.', 'And its for that reason that we kept a good amount of flexibility in the used fleet that well keep in service for next year.', 'Candidly, theres a few other candidates out there that we would like to retire a little bit more quickly, but were going to keep those in through next year as a bit of an insurance policy.', 'The two A320s that youre talking about are purchased this year and inducted in, I think, January, February or sometime during the first quarter of next year.', 'And then we have the MAX aircraft entering service late first quarter and building on that throughout the year.', 'On the high end, I would expect a total fleet count around 141, 41, but thats not guidance.', 'Thats about as high as it could go.', 'Savanthi Nipunika Prelis-Syth Thats helpful.', 'And then if I might, youve heard some of your competitors talking about where a lot of the extra capacity is in some of the kind of bigger markets, crowded markets and wanting to redeploy the capacity.', 'Im wondering, and on the other hand, too, you have regional airlines that I think trends are bottoming and maybe starting to as you get into 24, possibly being able to pick up their utilization as well.', 'Just curious, kind of based on the visibility you have, what youre seeing from a competitive standpoint in your markets?', 'The relative level of competition has been quite flat for the better part of two years and is relatively in line with what we saw in 2019.', 'Obviously, the dynamics change a little bit who it is and where the (inaudible).', 'Savanthi Nipunika Prelis-Syth So youre just going to -- you cant see capacity grow with the way fuel stays at this level, and theres a good argument to suggest its been permanently changed given the environmental issues and whats going on in the world.', 'Capacity cant grow that much if people are going to make money.', 'Capacity has got to come out to raise pairs to offset the fuel increases.', 'So thats a macro statement.', 'Savanthi Nipunika Prelis-Syth Is that negative for your model, too, Maury, isnt it?', 'Because you talk about leader travel?', 'Im not going to sit here and say were going to grow like a weed, but we have better opportunities to grow because we have less competition.', 'I think were not facing a lot of headwinds that everybody else is with our 75% noncompetitive.', 'And that profile will continue, we believe, going forward.', 'So its not a rosy picture for the industry.', 'Im not going to sit here and say it is, but oil has to come down somewhat.', 'Its the big variable we can all face.', 'Gregory Clark Anderson And further, -- so remember, we can pull our September capacity down to half of what we do in July as a reflection of the broader fuel environment, recognizing that demand is thick enough in the peaks to withstand the capacity, and were going to withdraw it where it doesnt make sense for all factors, including fuel.', 'So I feel really good about how we think about capacity deployment in the face of persistent high fuel.', 'Our next question will be coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore.', 'Duane Thomas Pfennigwerth Drew, maybe you could just expand on your RASM commentary.', 'I think you made some statement like normal sequential change or normal seasonal change in RASM.', 'Could you just expand on that?', 'I mean just look back, I think I was leaving even like 2005 to 2019 sequential change in absolute TRASM from 3Q to 4Q seems to be the right barometer as were looking at 23.', 'So hopefully, that gets to what youre driving at.', 'Duane Thomas Pfennigwerth Yes.', 'It just looks like its up in -- or sorry, in 18 and 19, it looks like its up sequentially.', 'So I just want to make sure thats not what youre suggesting there.', '18 and 19, were definitely on the high end of -- if you look at it all, how many in 14, 15 years there.', 'So I would expect something sequentially less than that, but in line if you take a (inaudible).', 'Duane Thomas Pfennigwerth (inaudible) could be a 2- to 3-year ramp, but maybe in year 1, how youre thinking about it.', 'I think right now, its really too early for us to guide.', 'Were happy to just be announcing the date being able to kick off our bookings and get going on the marketing.', 'The real indicator -- the only real indicator that we have right now is group bookings that are on the books and weve got about 30,000 on the books and another 32,000 that are... That, yes.', 'So thats probably the best leading indicator right now.', 'Were still outside the booking window, and well know a lot more in about 90 days.', 'Duane Thomas Pfennigwerth Okay.', 'Well, good luck with the launch.', 'Our next question will be coming from Scott Group of Wolfe.', 'Maury, you made a comment about, I guess, the seasonality in Q3, we see that.', 'You made a comment about like Q4 is of lower margin this year.', 'I wasnt sure I was following your point.', 'Can you just maybe go back to that?', 'Well, it just goes to the theme that weve got more in the way of off-peak flying that we cant pick up as much as we have historically because of just utilization crews, all the things weve talked about.', 'Were somewhat relearning how to do all this stuff too, I might add.', 'But our first priority this year was to make sure we ran a good operation.', 'So we didnt -- we got conservative and pull back being pushy and edgy that we might have been in the past times.', 'If you go back to 19 versus 18, we flew 8 hours a day, and we came out of -- we only had, I think, like 75 airplanes down from 90 airplanes in 18 when we moved out of the MDs.', 'And we pushed the edge and that we saw dramatic benefits of being able to fly push the utilization up.', 'So those are the things we have to relearn and well do that.', 'Thats one of our top priorities going into 24 and beyond.', 'And then just following up on that last question, can you just maybe be a little bit more explicit with what youre assuming for RASM or at least what that historical 3Q to 4Q, absolute RASM trends should be?', 'I just want to make sure were all on the same page.', 'And then in an environment where capacity is up mid-single digits next year, any early thoughts how youre thinking about CASM for next year?', 'Yes, Ill take the first part and maybe I missed something a little around the table.', 'Just taking the absolute PRASM from third quarter, the absolute RASM from fourth quarter historically, weve tended to step up a little bit, not by a huge amount, low singles.', 'Thats generally what Im expecting.', 'So not a year-over-year commentary, but simply an in-year sequential.', 'Gregory Clark Anderson Scott, this is Greg real quick.', 'And I know we havent put out quarterly guide.', 'So were getting there, you can kind of back into it with the fourth quarter, but I think it might just be helpful to Maurys comment about the third quarter being the weakest seasonally for us and what you saw in the third quarter, airline EPS.', 'I just want to say that fourth quarter airline EPS, the midpoint of our guide, we expect it to be stronger than the third quarter.', 'Sometimes with the weighted average share count and whats happening on that side of the house and the lower overall share count that we have kind of highlights or pronounces the swings.', 'But I just wanted to make sure that, that came across that we expect the fourth quarter airline EPS to be higher than the third quarter.', 'And then sorry, BJ I didnt mean to jump in there on your 24 cost.', 'I mean were in the middle, Scott of our budget process for 2024.', 'So not ready to give a guide on CASMx for next year.', 'And Ill just say there are a lot of moving parts around delivery of the Boeing aircraft induction of those airplanes, having crew members ready, et cetera.', 'But on kind of the capacity guidance that Drew put out there, we would expect CASMx to be up a little bit next year.', 'I dont want to give a number yet.', 'Our next question will be coming from Daniel McKenzie of Seaport.', 'Maury, welcome back here.', 'A couple of questions.', 'I guess the first is really a housecleaning question on Sunseeker.', 'I know you dont want to elaborate on 2024.', 'But at least for the fourth quarter here, does the full year EPS outlook include or exclude Sunseeker revenue?', 'And then once it opens, can you share at least what youre seeing today in terms of occupancy and booked room rates?', 'Ill start with the first question.', 'The outlook on Sunseeker for full year 23 does include some revenue, but its very, very minimal, assuming that youre only open for 2 weeks out of the year, and youre just kind of barely opening are not expected to be at any kind of full run rate.', 'So theres some in there, but I wouldnt run away with that for 24 or 23.', 'And then I guess in terms of the occupancy room rates, I understand its in there.', 'And Drew, going back to your commentary of peak periods being scheduled to aircraft and crew constraints.', 'I am looking at the back half of December, and it looks like Allegiant flying is down 14% year-over-year.', 'And so I guess a couple of questions tied to that.', 'One, is that accurate?', 'And then secondly, is that tied to constraints?', 'And Im just wondering if we should model these constraints extending into peak March 2024 flying as well potentially.', 'I think what youre capturing there is some of the shift in the holiday timing as well.', 'So the -- lets call it, the third week of December was a pretty meaningful capacity in December of 22 as the travel started a bit sooner.', 'That week comes down, I believe its about 22%, and then you get a little bit of growth into the more peak, call it, last, I dont know, 10 days or so of the month.', 'So I think a competitor called this out as well that there will be a downshift in the mid part of December thats kind of captured on the upside in the beginning of January that I think explains most of what youre seeing.', 'Our next question for today will be coming from Connor Cunningham of Melius Research.', 'As you think about load factor versus yields, Im not trying to talk about price.', 'I mean just like from a high level as you think into 24, there seems to be a lot of discounting to fill seats.', 'So Im just trying to -- Im just curious on what youre viewing as the key priority in building revenue next year?', 'I mean at the end of the day, total revenue is the end game.', 'I think youll see yields be more resilient in the peaks and then us making sure that were capitalizing on $70 of an ancillary per passenger through the rest of the year, which is generally driven by load factor build as a general rule of thumb.', 'So I would kind of separate those two elements like that.', 'But at the end of the day, we need to make sure that were maximizing that ancillary component.', 'And then on the 1,400 route comment that you had all the opportunities going forward, Im just -- youve always had a lot of ad opportunities.', 'So Im just -- your cost structure is obviously a lot higher.', 'So Im just trying to understand how that changes with a higher cost base.', 'And then if you could just touch on where you sit with the pilots today and whats going on there, that would be helpful.', 'On 1,400 route, I mean, were still extremely confident in that.', 'I think you have to strip it back a little bit into a fixed versus variable type of thought on that cost structure, right, in fuel, well see.', 'I mean thats as variable as it gets.', 'But for the rest of the cost structure, it still supports all of these 1,400 routes as the fixed cost portion will kind of take care of itself as we get back to utilization, we get back to growing again, but again, thats not how we think about new network deployment.', 'Its all on a variable basis.', 'Gregory Clark Anderson Conor, its Greg.', 'I might try to hit on a couple of other parts there.', 'On the cost to Drews point, keep in mind, were accruing this year at least beginning in May, accruing for increased labor agreement with our pilots.', 'But increase in productivity of just a half hour in utilization per aircraft per day is worth like 0.5% of CASMx.', 'So you have that that I think over time, I mentioned that weve invested in this infrastructure where the infrastructure has outpaced ASMs, but were going to get back there.', 'And when we did the system cutovers, everyone has their day job and these are massive system cutovers.', 'And so the philosophy was measure twice, cut once, get it done, but its going to allow us to scale and grow more efficiently.', 'And then on the pilot side of the house, just the trends are meaningfully improving.', 'Just to put that into perspective, in the first half of 23, if you think about net new pilots, we were flat, whereas in the back half of 23, well have over 100 or we expect over 100 net new pilots.', 'One, attrition is meaningfully down.', 'But two, the classes are full and they remain full.', 'And in fact, applications over the past couple of months have more than doubled.', 'And I think our -- the shout out to our [Fios] team and the focus that they have in their pathway programs and making sure that were identifying the pilots that want to be here at Allegiant.', 'We have a unique quality of life offering overall, which is that out-and-back model, but the most important thing that we need to do, and I keep saying this is were working hard and were committed to getting a deal done for our pilots for our flight attendants and thats a key focus for us, and well carry that in and trying to get that done as soon as possible.', 'Cal, let me editorial on top of that.', 'You cant understand the mindset inside of an airline in March, February with the pilot issues going on.', 'You just didnt know what was going to happen, particularly if youre in the middle of the sandwich like we are where a lot of our guys are going up the hill to American Delta and United.', 'And can you -- we literally train 200 pilots in 22 and [Keptn].', 'So a lot of expenses going in just to training these guys, but now that youre seeing the world -- I mean, Spirit announced theyre not hiring any pilots for 24.', 'I mean theres a radical shift in mindset of how you can think about having access to crews.', 'And for us, we need to make sure we get -- we need some extra crews certainly for the Boeing as we transition.', 'So we needed to have that type of mindset and its there.', 'To Gregs point, get a contract done.', 'Our pilots are very much on board with growing this business, and were also being much more selective in who we bring into the business.', 'We need to know that they want to be in our model and want to be here long term, not to say we werent selective before, but it was much more could you fly an airplane than what are your personal needs.', 'So those are the kinds of things weve learned from this effort.', 'And not only us, but everybody in this industry is going to be much more comfortable that they can make a forecast on pilots and availability so you can put a schedule out 9 months from now and still operate it.', 'Our next question will be coming from Andrew Didora of Bank of America.', 'Maury or maybe Greg, just staying on the pilots here.', 'When where are you, kind of where do the negotiations stand right now?', 'And if you can, just what are some of the key holdups at this point?', 'Gregory Clark Anderson Hey Andrew, its Greg.', 'So earlier this year, we combined with the union, started remediation process.', 'And while were progressing candidly, its not at the rate Id like to see, but were still working through it.', 'And theres a variety of items were working through, but we understand the important items that we need to get done and to get a competitive contract is paramount in our view.', 'And I have all the confidence that well continue to make progress, and then well get a deal done.', 'Yes, Andrew, theres some practical applications.', 'Were both at the table young in our maturity in many ways in doing a contract.', 'This group of pilots has never been involved in negotiating a contract before.', 'And so theyre, I think, kind of feeling their way forward as to what they want to see in the contract, and you have proper people at the table that know how to do this.', 'So United American Delta have been 70 years.', 'They have 500-page contracts that they dont have a lot to talk about.', 'Weve got a lot of items that are still young and tender and both sides need to feel their way through it.', 'So to Gregs point, its been slower than we would have liked.', 'But we get the materiality in what we want to do.', 'But I think both sides are getting a bit of deal fatigue candidly, if I had to say, so just to get something done.', 'And as we all know, this is not -- these contracts never end.', 'Theyre just extensions until we sit down and do it again 3 or 4 or 5 years from now.', 'And then as a follow-up, I know you spoke a little bit about kind of the contracted deliveries for 2024.', 'In that context, how should we be thinking about CapEx for next year?', 'Were live in discussing some of this with Boeing.', 'What Ill tell you is in 2023, we were paying a large amount of predelivery deposits substantially focused on aircraft delivering in 24.', 'And so you would see the same thing in 24 for aircraft delivering in 25, given the new schedule.', 'I would expect CapEx to be elevated next year versus 2023, but dont have a guide for you yet.', 'Our next question will be coming from Christopher Stathoulopoulos of Susquehanna Financial Group.', 'Christopher Nicholas Stathoulopoulos Thank you, operator.', 'Ill keep this to one.', 'Maurice, so I want to understand if you could, a little bit more on the composition of your 2024 capacity with the idea here that not all capacity is created equal, it comes with different margin profiles, et cetera.', 'So I think you said 70%, 75% of routes, noncompetitive, 1,400 new domestic routes identified and that you have a line of sight or looking to get back to 2019 utilization levels.', 'On the other side of the ledger, mid-single digit ASM growth is below what youve typically done.', 'So as we think about the moving pieces and if you want to frame it, departure stage engage or however, else, is this about frequencies within existing dots, adding dots a little bit of both?', 'Just want to understand here the moving pieces that makes up and build into that mid-single-digit capacity guide in that soft CASMx guide that you gave for next year?', 'Christopher Drew here.', 'Probably a little early to get into all of those dynamics today.', 'I think maybe speaking fairly generally, I wouldnt anticipate seeing that utilization rebuild in the first half of the year with the flat ASM that probably goes without saying.', 'As we bring on the Boeing, we will get a little bit of gauge benefit as the 8200s will come in at 190 seats, which is larger than what we have today by a little bit.', 'I dont foresee massive stage differences through the year, although well get back to you maybe on that in 90 days.', 'But I think as we think about the overall network, I would foresee a bit more frequency restoration coming earlier than new route announcements than kind of relative to our typical split before probably more on the late 24, but really more of a 25 and 26 story on network expansion would be my guess at this point.', 'The main thing to think about for CASMx next year is really just the full year of the pilot payroll cost and the full year of labor agreements that were implemented this year.', 'Other than that, we dont have most of the other buckets moving so much on the capacity that we just outlined.', 'Our next question will be coming from Helane Becker of TD Cowen.', 'Just 2 maybe clarification questions.', 'All your peers are calling out maintenance and you didnt really mention that.', 'Is there something -- I mean, whats different between you and them?', 'I think one of the things is potentially that our heavy maintenance is capitalized or we use the deferred method.', 'And so you dont see the immediate impact of it in the period that the cash goes out.', 'So there has been some pressure in heavy maintenance expense, not to the degree that like weve been hearing from some of the other carriers calls, but also expecting some pretty nice relief on that as we move through 24 and 25 and those aircraft with the most expensive heavy checks would be retired prior to undergoing that maintenance.', 'Thats really helpful.', 'And then for my follow-up question, the other thing that some of your compete...', 'I dont know if theyre really competitors, but some of the other airlines have been calling out has been too much capacity in Las Vegas.', 'And you didnt mention that either.', 'And yet, Las Vegas tends to be one of your larger locations.', 'I dont think its the largest anymore.', 'I think thats shifted around the network.', 'But maybe can you talk a little bit about what youre seeing in Las Vegas?', 'And I guess the Grand Prix is coming pretty soon.', 'So Im imagining [or Nsar] step-up in traffic there in addition to the holidays.', 'Just because Vegas has seen incremental seats does not necessarily mean that Allegiant has seen incremental seats on top of ourselves into Vegas, our route and where we originate customers tend to be pretty differentiated.', 'And the price points havent leaked into connecting traffic in a way that we saw in like 2015 when you could get to Vegas one stop for $100.', 'So that has not manifested yet.', 'So we still maintain a really solid network differentiation here that I think kind of puts us on an island, if you will, there.', 'In terms of F1, Canada has been a little wrong on this.', 'I went into it saying that it would probably be the worst suite that Allegiant has ever had coming into Vegas.', 'And luckily, that has not manifested, youve seen hotel pricing come down here looking at Scott DeAngelo, but 50%, 60% in places that I think is catering back towards -- away from the core F1 customer and more towards say, Vegas experience and have some fast cars going on around the bend.', 'So it will be fine, but I wouldnt call it out of anything that I believe will be super special for us.', 'F1 is -- Vegas is a mid-priced town.', 'Its not a high-end town like Monaco or something like that.', 'And the hotel prices were starting off the stratosphere and you cant blame them theyd start there and then come down.', 'But its going to be a zoo here that weekend, but its $20,000, $15,000 to get into [panic] as they call it.', 'Those are not the usual Vegas prices.', 'Maurice, Im really disappointed that you havent done an Investor Day at Allegiant Stadium in conjunction with one of the football teams there.', 'Well put it on the list.', 'Helane, thats a good idea.', 'One moment for our next question.', 'Our next question will be coming from Catherine OBrien of Goldman Sachs.', 'Catherine Maureen OBrien And welcome back, Maury.', 'Maybe just 2 quick ones on some of the ancillary revenue buckets.', 'I thought it was great you shared that remuneration year-to-date on the credit card.', 'I guess, is that similar to the revenue impact?', 'I understand there is a bit of a timing difference there.', 'And I guess, any thoughts on what the tailwinds are, theyre going forward?', 'Like how should we think about -- if were talking mid-single-digit capacity growth, are we thinking about credit card remuneration above and beyond that?', 'And Ive got one more.', 'This is Scott DeAngelo.', 'Ill take the first couple of parts there.', 'So the way to think about it is a rule of thumb, about 75% to 80% of total compensation is recognized in any given year.', 'A portion of what we get paid gets immediately recognized and the other portion is deferred, and its in effect subsidizing a cardholder when they use points to buy air travel and it gets recognized as revenue once those points are redeemed.', 'In terms of tailwinds, theres a couple of things that Ill speak to a high level at.', 'We are aggressively pursuing whats referred to as a second look program.', 'So an augmentation of our credit card program that to the customer looks no different, but its other issuers who are willing to issue in the subprime and the near prime spaces which currently are largely unserved by our product, and that enabled us to open the aperture, if you will, on approval rate.', 'And then finally, the other thing were doing is marketing more aggressively, not just in the plane but through digital and even in some cases, traditional advertising to build preference for and drive applications for the card in a way that weve never done before.', 'So all of those things combined, we expect to continue to plan tailwinds.', 'Last point, we currently sit at about 3 percentage of our loyalty program has the card.', 'Mature airlines, Delta and American, I believe, [Bold] made this public were more in the 13% to 14% of their loyalty program.', 'So that gives you kind of an idea of what upside is there if these tailwinds above and beyond the traditional ASM growth can drive us down.', 'Gregory Clark Anderson And Katie, its Greg.', 'I just want to add one quick point to what Scott mentioned there.', 'And thats the network that we serve and the communities that were in, so many of them were a really big deal.', 'And our card is aspirational, they want that card.', 'And its a great, I think, kind of program that we continue to build on thats unique to Allegiant because, again, in those markets we are the game in town.', 'Catherine Maureen OBrien Thats great.', 'And then maybe just one sorry.', 'Just on Allegiant Extra, I know you talked about a positive contribution, but could you just put a finer point on that?', 'Like whats the average buy-up on an extra seat or can you talk about how revenue growth is trending on a maybe versus Allegiant extra fee growth?', 'Any help there would be great.', 'I think this is something we continually say, Hey, well dive into more detail at an Investor Day and really provide some good stuff there and we even keep pushing the Investor Day.', 'So I promise well get there at a future Investor Day.', 'In terms of occupancy, we tend to get by right around the 50% mark, give or take, at a pretty meaningful unitized rev over any other seat.', 'So were -- I think weve stated about $1 per passenger in the past but I think that might be a little bit conservative as weve seen continued growth.', 'Catherine Maureen OBrien Right.', 'Maybe Ill just throw another location into the ring with Helane.', 'Id love to go see Sunseeker so keep us close on that one.', 'And our last question for today is coming from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley.', 'So Maury welcome back and I just wanted to follow up on something you said earlier about how high jet fuel prices kind of almost forces capacity die across the industry.', 'We have seen some indications of that on the 3Q conference calls with some of the low-cost carriers talking about muting their growth plans for next year.', 'Do you think the industry finally gets it on capacity discipline for next year?', 'Or do you think theres kind of still a little bit of proof needed on kind of walking the talk there?', 'Weve got, what, 30, 40 years of deregulation history bucking a new 10 trend.', 'If you want to take a comparable one, price of oil has gone up dramatically since February 22, but you havent seen the fracking industry run out and put a lot of new wells in.', 'Theyve caught a lot of grief from your compatriots about saving investment and make some money.', 'So youre seeing behavioral changes there, which have, I think affected supply and the U.S. has always been the counterbalance for oil and knocking the price down when it gets to rich from the Middle East and Russia and those guys.', 'So maybe you have new trends there.', 'I think the industry is very focused on making money.', 'The big guys are definitely showing that they like having those numbers.', 'Theyve got a very well-rounded product, theyve got a lot of debt on the balance sheet they want to pay down.', 'So making good money the way they have is maybe becomes infectious.', 'But long term, making money is the name of the game.', 'And what youve seen over the last 3 years, 4 years is weve all been thrown out of our habits and what weve done historically, I think American Delta and United have benefited by the kind of the stuff they did pre-pandemic and brought it to home here in the last few months and last year with both international being so rich and with the ability to offer competitive products.', 'When you look at the ULCC market, as I said, theyve got over a 90% overlap in their marketplaces.', 'Thats tough competition to go up against if youve got a comparable product thats sitting there with a well-known brand that has a credit card, has all the attributes.', 'So we like staying out of peoples way in doing those things but as far as capacity growth, I think its youre certainly not going to see kind of a wide-open funnel like we saw in the mid-teens and the like in my mind.', 'Could it get there a couple of years from now?', 'But right now, I think everybody is a bit cautious and wants to bring it back slowly.', 'And sitting on top of all this is ATC.', 'When youre being asked to cut your summer travel into New York City because ATC cant keep up, thats a big whack to your operation and your bottom line.', 'Always appreciate your thoughts.', 'There are no more questions in the queue, and I will now turn the call back over to Maury for closing remarks.', 'Thank you all very much for your time.', 'I appreciate your interest and well see you in 90 days.', 'Thank you for joining.', 'You may all disconnect, and have a great day.']",['Q3 2023 Allegiant Travel Co Earnings Call'],['Q3 2023 Allegiant Travel Co Earnings Call'],"['Drew Wells Senior VP Chief Revenue Officer Allegiant Travel Company Gregory Clark Anderson

the quarter, Im pleased with our ability to execute on our short-term performance targets, we remain very excited about the long-term financial and operational opportunities for Triumph.', 'In particular, our performance serves as evidence that we continue to accelerate our future towards the targets we discussed at our September Investor Day.Turning to Slide 3.', 'Ill summarize the highlights for the quarter.', 'Year-over-year organic sales growth was 16% and driven by improving MRO demand, accelerated above Q1s 14% growth and above our original guidance.', 'Aftermarket sales increased year-over-year accounting for a robust 43% of our Q2 sales, roughly doubled since the start of our restructuring.Recall our Interiors business started the year slow, with slower ramps in sales, supply chain delays, inflationary pressures and unfavorable foreign exchange headwinds.', 'The team began executing on our recovery plans and exited September at breakeven on increasing volumes and growing backlog.And last, we grew our total company backlog by 15% above market growth rates as Triumph benefits from strong representation across a broad array of platforms, customers and end markets.', 'We continue to benefit from growing commercial travel demand up 28% through August year-over-year.', 'and increased MRO demand as aircraft returned from peak summer use, commercial transport aircraft new orders more than 2,000 year-to-date and planned OEM rate step-ups.Book-to-bill is 1.37 year-to-date and $1.8 billion of reportable backlog is up 16% year-over-year, even as past due backlog has been driven down by $17 million or about 18% this fiscal year-to-date.', 'In the military market, there is a robust U.S. defense budget in place and expectations for it to remain at similar levels for the next few years.', 'Given the multiple regional conflicts, budgets are likely to grow beyond current forecast.', 'Triumph is currently engaged in an unprecedented number of military OEM opportunities including over 30 classified RFPs year-to-date.', 'We are in discussions on hydraulic systems, fuel pumps, landing gear systems, thermal systems, gear boxes, door actuation and more.', 'all driven by expanding Triumph intellectual property.In Q2, Triumphs commercial OEM shipments were up 70% year-over-year, while commercial aftermarket revenues rose 48% year-over-year.', 'Military OEM sales were consistent with prior year, while military MRO rose 24% year-over-year on the strength of many programs, led by V-22 pylon conversion actuators.As we shared at our recent Investor Day, Triumph enjoys significant content on Boeing 787 aircraft with just over 1 million shipset value, benefiting both the OEM and MRO sales across 6 Triumph factories.', 'This is a great aircraft with more than 1,800 orders since 2013 and a backlog of nearly 800 aircraft, 235 of which were ordered in 2023.', 'So demand is robust, and Boeing is working to increase rate as rapidly as possible.', 'Orders in our portal support the move to rate 5.3 per month in our fiscal year, up nearly 2x from the start of our year and 787 shipments for the second quarter were up 142%.', 'We also anticipate emerging sustainment requirements for the 787 as the oldest aircraft in this fleet are just beginning to exceed 10 years in service.As these aircraft enter their landing gear maintenance cycle, Triumph will begin overhauling increasing numbers of our landing gear actuation components, including extended retract actuation, truck positioning, nose wheel steering and door actuation.', 'New wins for the quarter included CH-47 engine controls, a UH60 gear package and an accessory repair package for Atlas Air as well as personal service units, cruise seats and starters for Delta Airlines.While only 10% of our sales performance at our interiors business remains a focus area, as an unfavorable sales mix driven by OEM delays and supplier shortages along with margin impacts from inflationary pressures on materials and labor and foreign exchange changes, created headwinds to start the fiscal year.', 'Were running additional Triumph operating system lean events to offset these external headwinds, and were starting to see positive developments.', 'These include events to drive down cycle time and improve efficiencies and productivity.As production demand increases, we are working closely with our customers to derisk the supply chain by securing alternate sources where necessary to keep cost competitive and to in-sourcing more work as rates continue to ramp, which will provide added absorption benefits.', 'Interiors is on a path to recover to mid- to high single-digit margins this fiscal year and to enhance the confidence in their long-term earnings targets.Value pricing remains a key strategy to Triumph is deploying towards our margin expansion goals.', 'This includes the implementation of our expanded commercial playbook, expanding our commercial risk reviews and implementing new processes.', 'Given the evolving market environment, this has included exploring shorter duration supplier and customer contracts, incorporating inflation clauses tied to indices or specific material pass-through clauses and focusing on aftermarket premiums and market access.Previously, we highlighted that 80% of our contracts have terms of 6 years or less, providing a near constant flow of opportunities to optimize value based on our technical solutions, capabilities and IP and our recent wins include examples of these efforts.', 'We remain on track with the pricing objectives laid out during the recent Investor Day.', 'Jim will now take us through our second quarter results and updated outlook for fiscal 2024.', 'Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone.', 'Triumphs second quarter results exceeded our expectations with significant revenue growth over the prior year period.', 'On Slide 5 are the consolidated results for the quarter.', 'Revenue was $354 million.', 'With the continuing business, excluding divestitures and exited programs, organic revenue increased 16% over the prior year quarter.', 'Organic revenue growth primarily benefited from increased aftermarket volume and pricing on our largest programs, while demand across most of our end markets improved during the quarter on a year-over-year basis.Prior year revenues included a $16 million nonrecurring benefit from the sale of noncore IP, after which revenue growth would be 23%.', 'Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $37 million, representing 11% margin, a 60 basis point increase over last year.', 'And adjusted EBITDAP for the quarter was $46 million, representing a 13% EBITDAP margin, which is on track to our full year guidance.Sequentially, adjusted operating margin was up 300 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin was up 220 basis points over Q1, driven by higher revenue and a favorable mix with an increase in aftermarket sales from 41% to 43% of total revenue.', 'In the quarter, we incurred $1.9 million of restructuring costs to retire our last structures IT contract as our transition services agreement ended, and a $1.3 million charge associated with potential environmental costs at legacy structure site.Slide 6 shows our military revenue.', 'For the quarter, military revenue was $117 million, representing 33% of total revenue.', 'Military OEM sales were strong and on par with last year as increased sales on CH-53K and B22 offset expected lower sales on E-2D and AH-64 programs.', 'Military aftermarket sales in the quarter were up 24% compared to last year and up 70% sequentially on increased demand for spares and repairs.Slide 7 shows our commercial market revenue.', 'For the quarter, commercial revenue was $227 million, representing 64% of total revenue.', 'Commercial OEM sales were $131 million, and absent the sale of noncore IP were up 17% in the continuing business.', 'This growth was driven by increases in both volume and price in key programs, including Boeing 787 and 737 programs.', 'Commercial aftermarket sales of $96 million grew 49% in the continuing business on strong demand for commercial aftermarket spares and repairs.', 'This is our highest quarterly commercial aftermarket sales since fiscal 2017.', 'Remaining 3% of our revenue is non-aviation, which is profitable and represents about $9 million of sales in the quarter.', 'Thats up 24% over last year.', 'Our continuing sales mix trend towards more aftermarket is having a positive impact on margins and cash flow.As I mentioned, total aftermarket sales represented 43% of our quarterly revenue.', 'This was up from 36% in the prior year quarter.', 'The breakdown of our aftermarket sales and MRO capabilities is on Slide 8.Our free cash flow work is on Slide 9, which shows our Q2 and year-to-date cash use.', 'Our $37 million of cash used this quarter included $74 million in semi-annual interest payments as well as planned investment in our net working capital in support of increasing second half sales volume.', 'This is consistent with our expectations and the quarterly free cash flow guidance we previously gave.', 'We expect to be solidly cash positive in Q3 and in Q4 in support of full year cash flow guidance, which is up to $40 million to $55 million.On Slide 10 is our net debt and liquidity.', 'As of September 30, we had $1.5 billion of net debt and our cash availability was approximately $230 million.', 'During the second quarter, we purchased $19 million of our unsecured 7.75% senior notes due in August of 25, and we purchased an additional $29 million so far in the third quarter.', 'We purchased these notes at a discount to par resulting in gains.', 'When combined with the $14 million in bond redemptions in the first quarter, we reduced annualized interest expense by about $5 million.', 'We also have over $300 million deferred tax assets to continue to create value through reduced cash taxes moving forward.Our fiscal 24 guidance begins on Slide 11.', 'We are increasing our fiscal 24 guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and cash flow and updating our operating income guidance.', 'Based on anticipated aircraft production rates, we expect organic growth of 10% to 13% in fiscal 24, with revenue in the range of $1.43 billion to $1.47 billion.', 'Aftermarket volume is the largest component of the increase, followed by OEM volume, pricing and an increase in non-aviation revenue.', 'The aftermarket is expected to grow at 11% rate for the fiscal year.Commercial OEM revenue growth is driven by production ramps on following 737 and 787 programs and the Airbus A320 family, even while supply chain and geared turbofan repairs are considered.', 'Non-aviation sales are expected to increase, driven by the previously announced work supporting hollister sustainment.', 'We increased our adjusted EBITDAP guidance consistent with the increased sales guidance to a range of $216 million to $231 million.', 'Our adjusted EBITDAP margin guidance continues to indicate up to a 16% consolidated EBITDAP margin in fiscal 24, representing roughly a 200 basis point improvement over last year.We increased our cash flow from operations and free cash flow guidance ranges by $5 million for fiscal 24, including second half working capital improvements.', 'We continue to expect solid cash generation in Q3 and strong cash generation in Q4, consistent with prior year seasonality.', 'This is driven by working capital liquidation on the second half sales surge, reduction in past-due backlog and increased OEM inventory turns.Interest expense is expected to be $151 million, including $145 million of cash interest, and we expect $7 million of cash taxes.', 'This is after the cash interest savings from $49 million of bond purchases completed to date.', 'Organic margin expansion, cash generations and debt reduction are expected to drive our net leverage from 7.6x at the end of last year to between 6.1x and 6.3x at the end of this fiscal year.As we discussed at our Investor Day, we are on a path to reduce leverage into the range of 3.5x no later than the end of fiscal 26 through EBITDAP expansion and free cash flow generation.', 'However, Triumph continues to explore alternatives to accelerate deleveraging through business and product line portfolio actions.In summary, the second quarters results are in line with or ahead of our expectations that support the increased full year guidance.', 'We are reducing debt and interest expense by purchasing bonds in the market, growing EBITDAP and generating free cash flow this year.', 'Were executing our multiyear plan to continue to grow revenue, margins and free cash flow, reduce leverage and increase shareholder value.', 'We remain on track to achieving the targets established at our Investor Day in September.Now Ill turn the call back to Dan.', 'Triumphs performance in the second quarter of fiscal 24 highlights the strength of the new Triumph, the stronger systems and aftermarket driven company with a growing IP portfolio and backlog yielding steadily improving financial results year-over-year.', 'We expect improved financial and operational performance to continue throughout the fiscal year as our expanding mix of aftermarket and IP-driven OEM sales gives us confidence in our updated fiscal 2024 guidance and long-term outlook.Jim and I are happy now to take any questions you have.', '(Operator Instructions).', 'Todays first question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.', 'I wanted to ask, in terms of the improvement in the overall outlook, was there any change to the outlook for the Structures business -- or sorry, the Interiors business now.', 'I guess in other words, should we think that Interiors, maybe there are some more challenges there and that was more than offset by the goodness that you see in FNS?', 'Yes, thats how I see it, Seth.', 'We had printed 13% in the quarter despite being breakeven in Interiors.', 'And let me characterize Interiors revenue profile for the year.', 'They started the first quarter of the year with a monthly sales of $10 million to $11 million in the second quarter, that went to $10 million to $12 million.', 'For Q3, were looking at $11 million to $14 million per month, and then in Q4, $15 million to $19 million.', 'So very strong second half sales.We also jumped on it with a return to green program to drive productivity we saw about 10% improvement in productivity through the months of September and October.', 'And these are really two well-run plants in Mexico.', 'The challenges have been external, both foreign exchange and input costs, and were addressing both.', 'On the input cost, were competing the suppliers that have raised prices so that we have alternatives.And on foreign exchange, Ill let Jim address what were doing there.', 'Just to break down and Terry is a little bit further, its really three businesses within one business.', 'Even though its only 10% of sales, its a small contributor to Triumph overall.', 'The insulation piece, which is the biggest piece is a 20% margin is plus margin business.', 'And cabin production parts that we made that support the cabin and is sort of high single digits, where weve been losing money is in composites, which is mostly ducting, so were taking some actions to automate that plant.We just opened a new clean room there, and were doing additional lean events to drive that.', 'But overall, the plants are quite well run.', 'Its just dealing with these external headwinds.', 'But yes, we have a strong second half that we are counting on to be part of the overall trajectory of the company on both sales, cash and profit.', 'They are external drivers like inflation and FX or challenges and the wax and wane, but the reality is we have to get our costs down, and then we have to exercise a right to the contracts for adjustments where we have them.', 'And then where we dont, we have to go negotiate when new contracts come up, adjusted prices to cover those costs.', 'But the team is very active on remediating the challenges there.', 'But I think youre exactly right, that the system strength, which is so important is more than offsetting the Interior challenges.', 'And then maybe just one follow-up, if thats okay.', 'If we think about the military OEM business, and just maybe -- just on the OEM side, you think maybe theres a little more visibility in terms of the content you have and the expected build rates for the platform.', 'It seems like maybe this year can be up a little from last year, which is $260 million to $270 million of sales in the military OEM side.', 'How does that evolve going forward and what are the drivers?', 'Because I know theres probably some legacy rotorcraft that youre on and -- but also some growth opportunities.', 'So how does that piece of the business evolve?', 'We really do have a strong presence in helicopters, especially out of our West Hartford fuel controls, engine controls business and thermal products, but also gearboxes and heat exchangers.', 'So when you look at the rates, we just got the award for the LRIP 7 and 8 lot for CH-53 from Sikorsky, thats a program thats been building at about 0.8 aircraft per month, and its ramping up to over the next 3 years to double that.', 'So thats a nice tailwind for us.', 'MH60 is also growing in rate modestly.', 'We do a lot of gears for the age AH64 Apache, and that rate goes up about 10%, maybe 15% over the forecast.So while its not a doubling sort of build rate increase, unlike last year where we were marking down OEM rates, were finally swinging into positive.', 'And Im very encouraged about the new starts on military.', 'Were getting pulled into lots of bids, Fara, Flora on the helicopter side, are two examples, but also on the next-gen fighters as well.', 'So we see our competency in helicopter components being strength to the company.', 'I would also point you to Page 14, so we have the backlog there by program, and Ill give you more flavor over whats in the next 2 years and the military programs there from F-35, which is 2% of backlog right now, up to the CH-53 is 8% of backlog.', 'And half of those programs are rising in rate, half of them may be reducing in rate or some stable ones.', 'But its a good balanced portfolio of military OEM work.', 'And our next question today comes from Ellen Page at Jefferies.', 'Just going back to Interiors, you had called out FX as a headwind.', 'And the headwind in Q1 as well, how much of the loss was due to the peso?', 'And how do we think about reaching mid to high single digits in fiscal H2.', 'Just what are the kind of moving pieces there?', 'Rough [less been] about $500,000 per month would be peso at the current rate, as you know, the peso strengthened to some all-time highs against the dollar.', 'But that will change over time, and well have the opportunities to reprice and address cost structure to help mitigate that.', 'So thats the piece thats FX related.', 'But Dan talked about some of the actions were taking, which are going to increase the second half.', 'I think volume is one of the biggest drivers.', 'So really expecting a lot more volume in the second half.', 'The mix changing back towards installation, which is more profitable than the ducting is, and some of the cost mitigation actions were taking as well.', 'Can we just go over the moving pieces to the free cash flow guide.', 'You raised OCF by $5 million, I believe.', 'What were the key drivers there?', 'The key driver is really the sales, which is driving profitability, partially offset by the increased working capital needed to supply the higher sales in the second half of the year.', 'So theres -- its a modest increase, but its an important one, and its consistent with those higher sales.', 'What weve been watching very closely, in fact, at the Board level, is the reduction in past-due backlog and working capital because theres been multiple currents within the working capital flow.', 'Weve been investing in working capital for the rotables, for MRO.', 'Thats helped us drive our strong MRO sales and then also protecting OEM ramps by buying more.', 'But at the same time, we want to increase turns on the MRO or on the OEM side.', 'So what we saw in September, October were improvements in both measures, both the past due burn down and the turn.', 'So thats the leading indicator we need to see that confidence that were going to improve working capital in the second half of the year.', 'And our next question today comes from David Strauss with Barclays.', 'On Interiors, would you expect it to get to EBIT or EBITDA positive in Q3?', 'So were exiting breakeven in September.', 'So yes, we expect to be breakeven to positive in Q3 and strong -- solidly positive in Q4 to get back to the mid- to high single digits for the year.', 'And Jim, on free cash flow, I think if I go back to the bar chart that you had in the Q4 slide deck.', 'It looks like Q2 was a little bit weaker than what you were anticipating there if I just compare it to prior years.', 'If so, what was kind of where was the miss relative to your internal plan on cash flow?', 'And that bar chart implied a pretty big Q3 free cash flow number?', 'I know you said positive, but I just want to see if we could revisit kind of the sequential growth in free cash flow youre expecting Q3 and Q4.', 'David, at the end of the fiscal year, we reported, we put out the chart with the cash flow cadence for the 4 quarters that youre referring to.', 'But actually, after Q1, I updated that, and I said $30 million to $40 million cash used, if you look at the transcript for Q1.', 'And at the Investor Day, I reiterated that.', 'And the real driver for a slightly higher cash use was the higher sales were seeing.', 'There was some impact from supply chain and from demand changes.', 'But it was really the higher sales for the second half.So $30 million to $40 million used -- I guess we came in at $37 million used this past quarter, and we should be positive in that range for Q3 in the $30 million to $40 million cash positive and then the balance to get to our full year guidance would be in Q4.', 'So very strong Q4 as weve had in prior years.', 'But with this higher aftermarket percentage at 43%, with even more seasonality and with the ramping production rates I think were going to have a stronger Q4 than weve ever had before.', 'And taken together, year-over-year, its a swing of about $120 million to $130 million in cash flow for the full year.', 'So we feel very good about the trajectory on cash.', 'And Jim, just the net working capital that youre assuming now for the full year, how much of use are you anticipating?', 'I dont have a working out to that level.', 'Its obviously going to be coming down in the second half of the year.', 'And I have to follow up on that and look forward to giving you more information about that moving forward to the absolute working capital level.', 'I can tell you that we are driving turns down, and we have a concerted effort on inventory management to get the turns down to improve the working capital moving forward.And its the right time to do it with ramping sales because we have lots of inventory and we have lots of opportunities to be more efficient with it.', 'Were trying to find the right home for inventories, working with vendors and customers who may have lower cost of capital than us, for vendor managed inventory, customer-owned inventory.', 'So the direction is positive, and were going to be liquidating working capital in the second half of the year.', 'And our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen.', 'So your aftermarket business was strong in the second quarter and a very good sequential gain.', 'Based on what you said about the year, it looks like the rate of growth in aftermarket sales will be much more modest in the third and fourth quarter.', 'Could you give us some color on what you expect commercial and military aftermarket to do sequentially in the third and fourth?', 'And if thats the case, which it looks to be the mix would look like it would be a little bit leaner and yet your adjusted EBITDA numbers seem to assume very good margin improvement sequentially with a mix shifting towards more OE.', 'Help us understand that, if you could.', 'Certainly, the commercial aftermarket is the strongest driver of the growth.', 'Weve seen outperformance year-to-date, and we expect that to continue in the second half.', 'The visibility thats not -- its harder because youre looking at market data.', 'Youre not getting the actual orders in, its not a backlog business.', 'We may only have 45 to 60 days worth of orders visibility for that.', 'So I think there may be a little conservatism on what the mix will be.', 'We know what OEM rates are, they can change, but the aftermarket mix I think its stable moving forward.', 'Commercial is still strong.', 'Military usually has a big surge in Q4.', 'We see a lot of spares orders in our fiscal Q4.', 'But we dont provide guidance by market segment.', 'Wed like to tell you the trends, but sometimes one segment outperforms that helps cover underperformance in other segment.', 'Thats the benefit of our balance of diversification.', 'So basically, youre saying that the mix should be the same going forward?', 'Or is the mix shifting toward OA net-net?', 'I dont think its going to shift towards OE because the aftermarket is stronger in the fourth quarter, in particular, both for military and commercial.', 'So I guess theyre probably going to be more aftermarket in the second half of the year, but it depends on the OEM rate ramps.', 'At the moment, I think aftermarket is probably going to overtake and continue to be stable to increasing as a percentage of our sales.', 'And our next question today comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research.', 'Myles Alexander Walton So just actually a clarification on Cais question.', 'So the Slide 8, is that referring to that 11% growth in fiscal 24?', 'Is that referring to the whole channel of MRO or the commercial channel in insulation?', 'So we have about $152 million, I think, of sales, and thats the breakdown for the quarter of sales by aftermarket.', 'Its broken into third-party MRO where its not RIP necessarily and the spares, which obviously can be the highest margin.', 'And then the third pieces are IT, which are higher margin typically than repairs on third party.On the bottom of that page, you can see we have the Q2 and the year-to-date breakdown for all those components.', 'Myles Alexander Walton You mentioned the portal showing you 5.3% per month on the 77.', 'Could you also share what its looking at for the 37.', 'And maybe, Dan, that big growth youre anticipating in Interiors, I imagine thats primarily inflation driven on the 37.', 'Its one of the largest programs in Interiors for sure, but its certainly not the only one.', 'We have A220 work out of Airbus.', 'So its a mix of programs, but it is the largest.', 'On the OEM rates, Boeing has talked quite publicly about their step up to 38, whether its going to come in the calendar Q4, the following quarter.', 'But were building at rates that are approaching that now, and were typically, on average, about 1 quarter setback from them.', 'So as they ramp up, were already delivering into the pipeline, sometimes to intermediaries and then products that flow to Boeing.', 'So our factories are building at rates of 30 to 35 a month right now.', 'And in priming for rates that go up into 40 next year, or fiscal 25.', 'So thats the general MAX-737 outlook for us.', 'Airbus is a similar story.', 'Were building at rates that are in the high 40s and planning for rates for the 50s next year and 60s thereafter.', 'Myles Alexander Walton And just one last quick one.', 'When you mentioned portfolio actions in terms of pursuit of the balance sheet, improvement.', 'Could you elaborate on the size of any potential turning you might be looking at or business lines that you might be thinking about from that perspective?', 'Its one of these things every year.', 'Were looking at every business, trying to make sure were managing the portfolio for shareholder value.', 'But deleveraging is our top priority.', 'Debt reduction -- and so weve had inbounds for several of our businesses.', 'And one of the challenges is because were on a ramp across OEM and MRO, whats the value of these businesses.', 'You could understand that people would come calling when the rates have been depressed and were on the sort of, Ill call it, the base mountain climb of OEM and MRO rates.', 'So people who have interest in these businesses have to properly value them, but we want them to be needle movers for deleveraging, not just around the margin.', 'Our next question today comes from Michael Ciarmoli with Truist.', 'Michael Frank Ciarmoli Nice results.', 'Just to maybe go back, the DKL is pretty solid here on Slide 8.', 'And it looks like, I mean, spares were up 7% sequentially.', 'I mean can you maybe parse that out for us?', 'Was it more commercial?', 'Was it more military?', 'And kind of what youre seeing out there and what drove that level of spares activity.', 'It was more commercial this quarter.', 'And thats why I think the margin impact is a little less than you might see in some of the military spares.', 'But its lumpy business, as weve talked about before, where fortune was surged this quarter.', 'And the fourth quarter is typically when we see the biggest surge in the spares.', 'And there are opportunities to increase spares volume, which we continue to work on and increase spares pricing to cover increasing costs and enhance margins moving forward.', 'I know you have models for air traffic, but the ones we watched showed the first 10 months of U.S. traffic.', 'TSA volumes were above 2019 levels by 1.4%.', 'But more importantly, September and October, traveler throughput was up 5.7% over the year 2019 levels.', 'So its definitely ramping, and thats driving the carriers to invest in spares and repairs.', 'And the timing, you all commented on the strong commercial MRO sales.', 'As Jim mentioned, these fleets are coming out of service.', 'They hit their peak volume -- TSA volumes in July -- so theyre bringing them in for maintenance, and were benefiting from that.', 'Michael Frank Ciarmoli And then just -- I mean, you had been forecasting, I think 4% to 6% aftermarket growth, its now 11%.', 'Any -- can you give us any of the underlying military commercial?', 'Is it more spares, I mean, the IP sales look pretty flattish.', 'But maybe just what really drove that increase.', 'And I would imagine with the pratt issues, airlines flying some of these older planes longer has to help.', 'Well, weve been in touch with -- proud about ways we can help.', 'And its been a productive dialogue I would say right now, repairs are outpacing spares on the military side.', 'And that is going to, I think, revert as the depletion of U.S. stockpiles to support the various conflicts leads to orders for new spare hardware to replace those.', 'So these things tend to swing in their own cycles, repairs and spares, but thanks for the recognition of the progress on spares.', 'Last year, the spare sales were softer.', 'So were encouraged to see them coming back.Triumph does a lot of line replaceable units.', 'And thats really the beauty of the new portfolio is if you tour our plants, you see these actuators and heat exchangers and gearboxes.', 'And these are the items that are used up, consumed during operation and typically replace not a heavy maintenance but a frequent checks.', 'In terms of the mix of the driver of the increased growth as you can see, 2/3 of our aftermarket is repairs, 1/3 fares.', 'So its more repairs and spares and its probably a little more commercial than military for the back half of the year.', 'And our next question today comes from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America.', 'Just trying to understand what happened with the interiors duct work and the composite, if you can kind of go in more detail.', 'Like it seems like as of maybe last quarter that sort of came out of nowhere.', 'And I guess what Im worried about is, could this happen in another business or not?', 'Or I mean, how should we think about that?', 'And Im giving lots of inside baseball on interiors more than we ever have in the past.', 'But on composites, recall, we used to build these products, these ducts at our Spokane, Washington plant.', 'And we moved them to Mexico.', 'And at the time, a condition of transfer with Boeing is that we produce them in the same manner and we really missed an opportunity to relay out the line, add more automation.From their point of view, it was to avoid any changes that might lead to quality issues.', 'But now that weve stabilized production in Mexico, were going back to the line with Boeing partnership to take out further cost, and Im highly confident that were going to see the sort of productivity gains and composites that we saw -- that we do see today in installation.', 'This business has been a 20% plus business before and were focused on getting it back there, and we plan to exit this year with strong margins that are double digits on operating margins and then get it back into higher margins over our planning horizon.', 'And I would add, obviously, the cost challenges are multifaceted.', 'Theres inflation down there, thats been higher than we experienced in other countries.', 'Theres the FX headwind with the peso strengthening.', 'And then theres directed supplier costs that we can continue to work on because they have some sole-source directed suppliers.', 'And we have opportunities sometimes through adjustment clauses to recover that.', 'Sometimes we need to develop second sources or work to pass through the prices.', 'So theres lots of levers.', 'There was a -- it was a challenge, and it was a bit of a surprise in Q1, but were all over it and were going to improve it for the balance of the year.', 'And then, Jim, how are you thinking about -- I mean, really the refinancing that has to happen given where interest rates are now, I mean what -- you kind of alluded to theres maybe some creative things you could do.', 'Could you give us a hint to what youre thinking?', 'Well, as you know, opportunistics, so we continue to monitor the markets.', 'And if theres an opportunity to refinance that good cost in terms, we would consider doing that but were also improving the business dramatically, positive free cash flow this year, improving our credit.', 'So we dont want to move too fast that we dont get the benefit of our improved credit.', 'Weve recently seen -- I think Moodys upgraded our corporate family rating as well as our 25 bonds.', 'At the same time, were buying back with excess cash -- the bonds bought back at a discount, so we create a gain.', 'We reduced our interest expense.', 'Were going to continue to do that as we can with excess cash from cash flow from operations, from working capital liquidation.So were going to keep chipping away until it gets to a point where we can consider whether there are some delevering actions we can take with the portfolio, which weve talked about, or whether we want to refinance.', 'These arent due until August 25.', 'So they dont go current until next -- August next year.', 'But were keenly aware of it and were watching the markets.', 'So its not a big concern about refinancing, but we do want to delever.', 'So it would be best if we could just reduce that debt all together and not have to refinance.', 'And our next question today comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.', 'What is assumed in your 2025 and 2026 margin plan for the Interiors margin?', 'Im hesitating, no, because I dont know when we get into the margins of the segments, which we have given.', 'We said that -- this has been a 20% margin business in the past.', 'Ive said that this is easily back to the mid-teens on a normalized basis.', 'So you can imagine if were just coming out of September and breakeven-ish to look into -- with effect for the full year, have mid- to single high-digit on EBITDAP percentages, so you can expect to be in the double-digit percentages during those periods.', 'What Im most excited about is the growth in actuation and engine controls.', 'Actuation is going to hit, I think $500 million in sales this year and 20% plus on business with great aftermarket.', 'And engine controls is one thats getting a lot of that military MRO work and new wins on helicopters.', 'So even though Interior is getting a lot of headlines, its again, still 10% of the business.', 'But the core parts, what Ill call the crown jewels of the company, actuation, engine controls are really performing well.', 'Jim, the release and the presentation discuss debt -- recent debt reduction, but Im seeing a few different numbers, seeing a different number for the 2025s, and I thought was left there.', 'Can you just level set me on -- what did you pay down in the quarter?', 'What have you paid down since the end of the quarter?', 'And whats left on the 25.', 'So in the quarter, we paid down $19 million of the bonds.', 'And subsequent to the quarter, we paid down another $29 million of the bonds.', 'And back in Q1, there was warrants, $14 million of debt was retired as part of that process.', 'Unidentified Company Representative Take that off [$500], where were going to be right now.', 'And the -- it looks like youre saying on Slide 9 that, that action reduces interest expense and that flowed to the free cash flow guidance.', 'So it does reduce interest expense for the balance of this year, but on a full year basis, its $5 million.', 'So thats not in the year.', 'So this year is a piece of that and then a piece of just core business operations.', 'And then I guess related to that, thats a positive, but youve got the big 4Q where youre citing volume, which makes sense because of whats happening with sort of planned volumes.', 'But we -- you continue to operate in these end markets where the planned volumes are shifting around.', 'And so I guess, I was a little surprised you raised it given that, but at the same time, youre giving us these numbers halfway through the quarter here.', 'So I dont know whats the level of confidence in that number?', 'Or where is there a risk of something sliding out of the end of your year and into next year, on that free cash flow plan.', 'Were highly confident in our numbers, and we have a very detailed bottoms-up forecasting process by program, by site.', 'The risks come in the demand in the aftermarket, which we dont have long-term visibility, too.', 'And then, of course, OEM rates.', 'But I think its less on OEM rates as much as we talk about those with aftermarket being growing so much and being so important to the fourth quarter, thats where the risk is, its just demand.', 'And that demand is so diverse that I think its lower risk than a particular OEM rate schedule might be.', 'And working capital certainly is a big swinger, and were highly focused on that.', 'We ran dozens of lean events in October.', 'Were going to continue those through the second half of the year.', 'And were doing all the kinds of analysis on our material planning and work in process and finished goods and safety stocks and rotables and things that drive working capital.', 'So the rates do affect inventory burn down because the rates help us to draw up on whats on the shelf.', 'But thats one of the swingers as well, but were confident were going to make it.', 'And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes todays question-and-answer session and todays conference call.', 'We thank you all for attending todays presentation.', 'You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.']",['Q2 2024 Triumph Group Inc Earnings Call'],['Q2 2024 Triumph Group Inc Earnings Call'],"['Daniel J.

leads cargo airlines to pause fleet expansion.', 'The post Cargo airlines throttle back on aircraft leases, ATSG says appeared first on FreightWaves.']","['A number of freighter operators are starting to back out of, or postpone, commitments for upcoming aircraft leases, underscoring how the prolonged contraction in demand for air cargo shipping is squeezing cash flow across a wider cross-section of the industry.', 'Executives at Air Transport Services Group (NASDAQ: ATSG), a leading lessor of cargo jets that also provides cargo flying and other services, said Tuesday that weak interest from international airlines is a key reason why it lowered second-half profit guidance by $45 million and is taking a more conservative approach towards freighter investments.', 'The company presented a window into how pain from the freight downturn is spreading during an analysts briefing on its disappointing third-quarter earnings one day after the board of directors fired Rich Corrado and named its chairman, Joe Hete, as CEO.', 'Air Transport Services Group late Monday reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $137 million, 16% below the third quarter of 2022.', 'Other drags on performance included inflation, the conflict in Israel and unexpected maintenance.', 'The companys stock price dropped 23% on Tuesday and another eight points Wednesday to close at $14.32.', 'The stock is down more than 40% year to date.', 'Susquehanna Financial Group downgraded ATSGs stock to neutral because of the magnitude of the earnings miss against Wall Street expectations and the revised guidance, which likely will carry over into 2024.', 'Our new reality is that growth will be more difficult to achieve than before, said Hete, who once ran the company for 17 years and is tasked with shoring up results and investor confidence.', 'The markdown in second-half operating profit includes $24 million for the companys leasing business, Cargo Aircraft Management, because all-cargo airlines are scaling back on planned freighter leases.', 'The company now expects to deliver 16 newly converted freighters in 2023, three fewer than previously communicated.', 'It has commitments for 14 passenger-to-freighter conversions next year, two less than listed during the summer.', 'In mid-October, we were contacted by certain airline customers of CAM expressing that they were experiencing lower customer demand, which is negatively impacting their financial results and outlook, President Mike Berger told analysts.', 'The air cargo industry is undergoing rapid changes this fall.', 'Unfortunately, we are not immune to that.', 'Many carriers arent in a hurry to take aircraft as they would be in a more robust economic environment, CFO Quint Turner added.', 'According to Mexican aviation news outlets, mas Cargo Airline has parked both of its Boeing 767-300s to optimize operations around a uniform fleet of Airbus A330 freighters.', 'Mas leases the 767s from ATSG and was recently scheduled to receive another one.', 'Berger said mas hasnt returned any aircraft so far and ATSG expects the airline to honor its lease commitments.', 'The decision, however, indicates there wont be any future growth with that customer.', 'ATSGs biggest commercial customers are Amazon and DHL Express, which lease aircraft and pay ATSGs two cargo airlines to fly packages on their behalf.', 'Passenger charter subsidiary Omni Air International flies troops and other personnel for the U.S. government, accounting for about 30% of company revenues.', 'The leasing business is increasingly placing aircraft outside the U.S. with smaller operators, most of which function as contractors for global express operators Amazon, DHL, FedEx and UPS.', 'The parcel giants, with double-digit declines in volumes, are rationalizing oversized air networks and partner carriers are feeling the trickle-down effect.', 'ATSGs comments are further evidence that more all-cargo operators and lessors are pausing new orders and, in some cases, reversing course.', 'Earlier this year, Cargojet canceled plans to buy and convert four Boeing 777s and Air Canada told Boeing it no longer needed two factory-built 777 freighters.', 'Cargo airlines ABX Air and Air Transport International are flying fewer hours on long-haul routes for international customers, with overall cargo hours down 4% during the quarter, management said.', 'But both carriers are on track to meet full-year targets for adjusted pretax income.', 'ATSG, until the third quarter, had largely escaped fallout from the ongoing freight recession, which has seen air cargo volumes fall about 13% since the end of 2021, with rate declines of 40% to 50% for the majority of this year.', 'During the second quarter, revenue increased 4% and adjusted earnings were on par with the prior year.', 'And there were few signs of customer backpedaling, other than Vietnam Airlines quietly canceling plans for two Airbus A321 narrowbody freighters.', 'Company leaders said last summer they would time future aircraft purchases closer to when production slots for conversions open up.', 'But investors pressured the cargo-focused company to downsize capital expenditures because of deteriorating market conditions.', 'Management responded in August, trimming $65 million from the investment budget for 2023.', 'On Monday, the company went further, cutting 2024 capital expenditures to $505 million, $100 million less than mentioned in September and $280 million less than this year.', 'Executives said their hybrid business model, which includes maintenance and airport ground services, gives them the flexibility to hold off on acquiring feedstock and moving ahead with the conversion process as market conditions change.', 'Hete said the aviation firm is not sending additional 767-300s for conversion beyond the seven currently in process.', 'Six Boeing 767 passenger aircraft already purchased on the second-hand market will be parked until demand improves.', 'CAM can still generate income from those assets by leasing out the engines to other operators, loaning aircraft to Omni Air if there is demand for more passenger service or leasing aircraft to a needy passenger airline, he said.', 'Berger said ATSG still has its eye on long-term growth, reiterating the refrain that e-commerce growth and airlines need to replace older freighters justified capital spending.', 'Airbus and Boeing have forecast air cargo demand will grow at a compound annual rate of about 3.5% to 4% through 2040.', 'Changing operating behaviors in the passenger sector, including greater use of smaller jets with better fuel efficiency on longer routes and more point-to-point flying that bypasses airport hubs, could also increase shipper interest for dedicated freighters.', 'Berger said Asia will be a magnet for converted freighters.', 'A big part of our future is international.', 'And we are a global organization.', 'Were looking forward to that growth going forward, he said.', 'Uzbekistan-based My Freighter on Wednesday took delivery of its first 767 cargo aircraft, Turner confirmed to FreightWaves.', 'The lease was initially reported by Cargo Facts.', 'ATSGs revenues were impacted by the return of 11 Boeing 767-200s in the past year after their leases expired.', 'The planes are near end of life and more expensive to operate than 767-300s currently being marketed.', 'CAM intends to sell two of the fully depreciated planes this quarter and more next year.', 'ATSG is also adding the Airbus A330 converted freighter to diversify its midsize aircraft offering as the availability of used 767 passenger aircraft begins to dry up.', 'An Airbus facility in October inducted ATSGs first A330 for conversion.', 'Israel Aerospace Industries, the Tel Aviv-based company that turns ATSGs Boeing 767s into a cargo configuration, lost a substantial number of employees who are reservists to military duty when the war against Hamas started a month ago.', 'Berger said ATSG has been in constant contact with IAI and is confident the supplier can meet upcoming delivery schedules.', 'Forty percent of the reduction in projected profits is associated with Omni Air.', 'Management said the outbreak of war in the Middle East caused the Pentagon to pause troop rotations at a normally busy time of year while it monitors the need to adjust its force posture in the region.', 'Analysts criticized leadership for being caught off guard by the change in fortunes, especially after delivering a positive message at Investor Day on Sept. 27.', 'The disappointing third-quarter results compounded shareholders perception that the company has underperformed for years, and Corrado took the fall.', 'Executives responded that the 767 sales werent finalized as expected during the quarter and that a late maintenance issue stranded an Omni plane in Guam for three days, resulting in unexpected hotel costs for about 250 passengers and crew, as well as overtime pay for pilots.', 'A lot of the deterioration occurred late in the quarter.', 'And we did not have that visibility at the time, CFO Turner said.', 'The Israel conflict, which also weighed on guidance, came after the quarter ended, he added.', 'Hete acknowledged the need to improve financial results and reporting lines to top management.', 'We dont find it acceptable.', 'Rest assured that that is top of the list of getting back in terms of where the numbers we put out are credible to the market, he said.', 'We believe new (and former) CEO Joe Hete is the best person to manage ATSG through this difficult period, with his focus on maximizing returns and taking a more measured approach to growth strategically right-minded.', 'At the same time, with ATSG finally delivering an investor day approximately just six weeks ago and then sharply pivoting on its outlook, we believe its going to take some time before investors are again comfortable with the story, said Susquehanna equity analyst Christopher Stathoulopoulos, in a client note.', 'Executives, including Corrado, have long lamented that investors and analysts misunderstand ATSGs value proposition, noting that the ability to secure long-term leases, and carry out dedicated contract flying for e-commerce customers, differentiates the company from traditional cargo airlines wholly subject to volatile market forces.', 'Stifel transportation analyst Frank Galanti said the market is overreacting to the downward revisions in guidance given future requirements for midsize freighters and expects the company to soon outperform low expectations, which will improve the stock price.', 'Satish Jindel, CEO of parcel consultancy ShipMatrix, blasted ATSGs board for making Corrado the scapegoat for a profit shortfall during a prolonged freight recession that was out of his control.', 'Corrado was Hetes hand-picked successor and Hete was able to provide mentorship as chairman.', 'No one should get the blame.', 'Shareholders should not set the direction of a company because they can be in today and out tomorrow.', 'They have no allegiance, Jindel said.', 'If the shippers, the customers, were complaining and employees were complaining about Rich Corrado, then yes.', 'And the board should not be wrapped up in trying to please the shareholders.', 'Meanwhile, the federal government is mediating stalled contract talks between subsidiary Air Transport International and its pilots union.', 'Talks have broken down over work rules, retirement and compensation.', 'On Oct. 30, the Air Line Pilots Association opened voting to give union leadership authorization to call a strike when legally allowed.', 'The sides cant initiate self-help tactics until the National Mediation Board releases them from the mediation process.', 'ALPA says 207 pilots have left ATI so far this year, a third of the current pilot roster.', 'Hete acknowledged that ATI is experiencing attrition, with pilots taking significant hiring bonuses to join mainline passenger carriers.', 'Other cargo and regional passenger airlines face similar staffing challenges.', 'At the end of the day, youve got to have a contract that works for both sides.', 'So if youve got the union side asking for FedEx or UPS wages or industry-leading, and thats not in the cards from what we get from our customers, then thats just not something we can agree to.', 'So the key is finding a happy middle ground between their demands and our needs to keep things

converting two more aircraft into cargo jets as the weak cargo market shrinks profit margins.', 'The post Cargojet to sell off new B757 freighters, pause 767 conversions appeared first on FreightWaves.']","['Cargojet, which operates a nationwide air cargo network in Canada for e-commerce express companies plus international services, is moving more aggressively to cap fleet growth and preserve strong cash flows in response to the continued slowdown in shipping demand.', 'The airfreight specialist has a surplus of Boeing 757 converted freighters and recently listed four of them for sale, Chief Financial Officer Scott Calver said Tuesday during a conference call with analysts about third-quarter results.', 'The planes were recently converted and had their engines overhauled.', 'It costs about $5.2 million to remodel a 757 for cargo, not including millions more for acquisition, according to industry experts.', 'Until a sale is consummated, the planes are available for lease to other airlines and still will be used for charter work, Calver added.', 'The move follows an earlier decision not to proceed with converting four 777-300 passenger jets.', 'One of the planes was sold during the summer at a $1.6 million (CA$2.3 million) loss, and two were sold in the third quarter.', 'They were severely damaged in a hailstorm, which delayed their sale.', 'Cargojet (TSX: CJT) received $8.8 million from its insurance claim, but the amount didnt fully cover repairs.', 'The fourth 777-300 was never purchased.', 'Management also said plans to convert two Boeing 767 passenger jets it owns are on hold.', 'Cargojet has 39 aircraft in its fleet, up from 34 at the end of 2022.', 'More than half of them are Boeing 767 medium freighters.', 'It expects to have 41 aircraft by the end of the year after two 757s it purchased complete conversion to cargo configuration, and 46 by the end of 2025, according to company figures.', 'The Canadian carrier is moving forward with the passenger-to-freighter conversion of four Boeing 777-200s under a contract with aerospace startup Mammoth Freighters.', 'Cargojet will operate the planes for DHL Express, one of its major customers and a minority owner.', 'But if the 757s are sold off, the number of aircraft will stay nearly the same.', 'Executives said they hope to get about $87 million for the midrange freighters or will use the parts on other aircraft in the fleet if a buyer isnt found.', 'Air Transport Services Group, a U.S. aviation firm that provides aircraft leasing and cargo services, is also cutting back on capital expenditures for fleet growth because of down market conditions.', 'Executives this week said they have put on hold plans to convert seven used Boeing 767-300 passenger jets that were recently purchased.', 'Cargojet reported revenue in the third quarter declined 8% to $155 million, partially due to lower fuel surcharges, and adjusted earnings before accounting measures fell 17% to $50.6 million year over year, in line with analysts estimates.', 'The airline flew 8.8% fewer hours during the period versus last year.', 'Domestic revenues were marginally lower at $64.4 million due to a decrease in e-commerce and B2B volumes, partially offset by inflation adjustments in long-term contracts.', 'CEO Ajay Virmani said consumer spending on household essentials is offsetting declines in discretionary items purchased through online channels.', 'Revenue from long-term transportation services agreements and one-time charters was $45.4 million, 9% below the 2022 level, as the company realigned international routes to match lower demand.', 'Nonscheduled charter work has picked up, and the carrier is taking advantage of extra aircraft and crews to meet that demand.', 'Chief Strategy Officer James Porteous said a 9% reduction in revenue from long-term transportation contracts and one-time charters reflected a realigned international route structure with shorter stage lengths to match lower demand.', 'In 2022, when shipping demand out of China was still strong, Cargojet operated two dedicated aircraft for DHL from Shanghai to the DHL hub in Cincinnati via Vancouver, British Columbia.', 'Those aircraft were shifted to routes in North and South America when volumes declined late last year.', 'Optimizing routes is the primary way a cargo airline can reduce waste, but Cargojet has also combated revenue losses with what Virmani called a new culture of frugality.', 'That has led to reductions in overtime, training and temporary employees.', 'Cargojet is also selling two Beechcraft that were purchased for crew transportation.', 'Management said it projects peak season to be flat year over year, which likely means sequential growth in the fourth quarter of 10% to

Allen McArtor, a former senior vice president at FedEx and administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration under President Ronald Reagan.', 'The emerging company took advantage of the airline sectors crash during COVID to structure very advantageous leases for mid-life aircraft at about half the going rate under normal market conditions.', 'GlobalX reported negative earnings, excluding non-core items, of $1.7 million in the third quarter, a $4.4 million improvement from the second quarter.', 'For the nine months ended Sept. 30, the hybrid carrier lost $13.2 million, $3 million more than the same period in 2022, before stripping out accounting measures.', 'With aircraft rent removed from the equation, earnings were $7.6 million.', 'The rapidly expanding fleet enabled the company to achieve record revenue of $42.6 million, up 38% from the year-prior period.', 'In its first full year of operation, Global Crossing generated $100 million in revenue and lost $15.8 million.', 'Starting an airline is expensive.', 'But executives stress they have laid the foundation for sustained profitability by scaling up the fleet and supporting infrastructure, including obtaining operating licenses and aircraft certifications in various jurisdictions.', 'They pointed to revenue growth outpacing costs for every expense line except maintenance as evidence of financial discipline and how continuing investments are making the airline more efficient.', 'And the growth in flight hours is faster than growth in maintenance costs, an indicator of improved efficiency.', 'During the quarter, the airline issued $35 million in bonds to repay current debt and provide capital for ongoing fleet expansion.', 'It previously raised $28 million.', 'Shareholders have been critical of the new financing terms of 15% interest, with a board seat and warrants for Axar Capital Management, but analysts viewed the deal as necessary to maintain the companys growth strategy and more favorable than equity financing.', 'GlobalX also reached an agreement with an airport developer for the financing and construction of a $25 million maintenance facility at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.', 'The facility, which is expected to open for occupancy in the second quarter of 2025, can hold three A320 variants or one A330-size aircraft.', 'Management said having its own maintenance capability will save money and drive efficiency because the airline will be able to control its schedule.', 'Buying hangar time to change an engine or do an overnight inspection at Miami International Airport (MIA) costs about $30,000 for an eight-hour period.', 'By the time the facility in Fort Lauderdale is ready, GlobalX will have 30 aircraft and many will be due for intensive maintenance checks.', 'The company has also invested in its own ground handling and fuel trucks to avoid having to rely on third parties that prioritized large customers and werent reliable.', 'GlobalX was experiencing two-to-three-hour delays because other fuelers at MIA prioritize serving American Airlines.', 'The leadership team says it is managing for long-term growth over quick earnings.', 'If we wanted to create a $150 million revenue company, we would be profitable today, said Chief Financial Officer Ryan Goepel during the earnings briefing.', 'But were building a $400- to $500 million-revenue company.', 'And the only way you can do that is investing in people, processes and systems.', 'Goepel, in other presentations, has said the companys goal is to have a $2 billion market cap in the next three to five years.', 'Airlines that dont grow, go bankrupt, added Wegel.', 'So we have no interest in operating a small airline because we will not survive.', 'Airlines with a larger base of aircraft and customers can better withstand external shocks.', 'GlobalX, for example, has doubled its pilot head count to 125 in the past year and fully expensed nearly $6 million to hire and train pilots during the quarter.', 'New pilots are on the payroll for 90 days before they start revenue flights.', 'Other building-block investments include flight dispatch technology and document management software to allow paperless functions.', 'The company offers three types of cargo service: on-demand, when a company urgently needs a shipment transported all-in contracts, in which a single customer charters the entire plane for multiple flights and long-term transportation service, in which the customer is charged a minimum number of flight hours and is responsible for finding cargo and paying fuel, ground handling and other fees.', 'The 2023 projected revenue ($150 million) share is 83% passenger business and 17% cargo, with cargo taking a larger slice in the future.', 'Management stresses that its cost-plus business model is much less risky than that of a fixed-cost scheduled carrier, which must operate whether the plane is full or not.', 'Every flight makes money, the company is paid in advance, fuel costs are passed through to customers, and unit economics continue to improve as block hours (flight and taxi time) increase.', 'Mid-2025 guidance is for cargo aircraft to generate $300,000 to $500,000 per month in earnings before non-operating expenses such as interest and taxes are counted.', 'Wegel scoffed at the notion that the air cargo market was currently too challenging for a new entrant to attract business, saying demand has simply reverted to the mean from the overheated days of the pandemic when anyone with a plane could make money.', 'Were not seeing any lack of demand on the narrowbody freighter side.', 'We are extremely busy flying for a whole host of different customers in the automotive markets, in the retail, he said.', 'In February, GlobalX began twice-weekly dedicated cargo flights to Havana for CubaMax, a travel and shipping agency based in South Florida.', 'Other customers include the U.S.', 'Postal Service, the West Indies Cricket team and Ascent Global Logistics, a GlobalX investor that owns USA Jets and specializes in moving auto parts from Mexico and Texas to U.S. assembly plants.', 'An HBO film studio earlier this year chartered GlobalX to move props and cameras for a shoot in Barbados and then back to New York two weeks later, Wegel said during a June interview at the companys Miami airport headquarters.', 'GlobalX freighters have made four circuitous trips to Israel, including two on Saturday, with more than 100 tons of medical and first-responder gear in the aftermath of the Hamas terrorist attack on Oct. 7.', 'It is one of the few U.S. carriers flying to Tel Aviv under war conditions.', 'On the earnings call, Wegel said staffing and supply chain issues at overhaul organizations that do the conversion work have delayed freighter deliveries, which are taking 10 to 11 months to complete instead of six to seven.', 'Modifications include adding a large cargo door in the forward fuselage area and a reinforced barrier wall in the upper deck to protect the crew cabin from shifting cargo.', 'Seats and other features designed specifically for passengers must also be removed.', 'Part of the problem, he said, is that the two conversion specialists for the freighter — 321 Precision Conversions and Airbus affiliate Elbe Flugzeugwerke GmbH — are still figuring out how to streamline the production process and which parts to preorder.', 'Production time is eventually expected to get faster.', 'A source at one of the rebuild specialists said A321 aircraft for multiple customers have been held up by overhauls of landing gear because vendors have had trouble getting parts.', 'Global Crossing is the only operator of the A321 converted freighter in North America, and executives are very confident the aircraft, which hit the market less than three years ago, is a rising star.', 'They insist it outperforms the Boeing 737-800, which entered the market about six years ago and has about 13% less volume.', 'Whenever we sit down with a potential client who is flying with a 737 or a 757 and we show them the operating performance of our airplane versus their airplane, we win that discussion every time, said Wegel.', 'He pointed to Lufthansa Cargo, Japan Airlines and Qantas as examples of large airlines that have also settled on the A321 for regional express routes.', 'The A321 beats the 757 with 18 more cubic feet of containerized payload capacity and burns about 19% less fuel, which translates to 300 fewer gallons on a long trip, according to the company.', 'It has room for 14 upper-deck containers, one fewer than on the 757, and 10 smaller containers in the lower hold.', 'But the 757 and 737-800 fuselages are too narrow for the LD3 containers and can only take loose cargo in the lower deck.', 'A321 proponents view the aircraft as the natural replacement for the aging Boeing 757 converted freighter, in large measure because containerized storage of high-volume, small packages is more efficient than manual exchanges of individual parcels to and from the lower hold.', 'For reasons having to do with schedule frequency, infrastructure, cost and ground handling, not all airlines utilize containers in the A321 belly.', 'Mike White, a consultant who for decades held cargo leadership positions at trade associations and airlines, said in an interview that the A321 is a good fit for North America, Central America and the northern tier of South America because of its range and cargo capacity.', 'Global X is waiting for final approval from authorities in Colombia for an air operators certificate that would enable it to establish a cargo airline in that country and serve the intra-Latin America market.', 'It would be one of the first A321 freighter operators in Latin America.', 'Planes assigned to Colombia will be interchangeable for use under U.S. authority.', 'Having an airline subsidiary in Colombia will also help with recruiting pilots, who would also apply for green cards so they can work in the U.S. and reduce the need for U.S.-based pilots, Wegel has previously said.', 'The airline is already hiring to get ready for test flights in the coming weeks to prove the airlines capability to safely operate, the CEO recently said on LinkedIn.', 'He has even talked about setting up a subsidiary in Europe.', 'The startup carrier plans to up-gauge toAirbus A330 cargo jets, but it will be early 2026, at the soonest, before the larger aircraft can be added to the fleet because production slots at conversion centers are filled up, Wegel told FreightWaves.', 'In the meantime, the company is working towards flying its first A330 passenger aircraft by next summer.', 'Learning how to operate the aircraft will help when its time to bring on freighters, he added.', 'Wegel acknowledged the company is undercapitalized but not unusually so for the airline sector, and said strategic support from key shareholders, fundraising and cash from operations make it possible to meet its target growth strategy.', 'The over-the-counter stock sits at 65 cents per share.', 'The company plans to uplist to a major exchange in the future.', 'More than 30% of outstanding shares are owned by insiders.', 'Click here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.', 'Cargojet to sell off new B757 freighters,

1944.', 'Other prominent fighter jets during the era included Lockheed F-80, Gloster Meteor, and Heinkel He 162.', 'The second-generation of fighter jets catered to the need for more innovation, which resulted in jets being equipped with homing missiles and radars to improve the accuracy and managing aerodynamics, which was previously hard because of high speeds at which these jets traveled.', 'The third-generation jets came to be known for their multi-purpose roles.', 'Not only were they able to carry weapons, but also engage in aerial interceptions, and deploy missiles and bombs.', 'A major shift in technology and avionics came with the advent of fourth-generation aircraft that equipped fighter jets with infrared capabilities, maneuverability, fly-by-wire, and synthetic radars.', 'These jets were a major advancement in stealth and aerodynamics.', 'The most notable fighter jet of this era was the General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)s F-16 Fighting Falcon.', 'Fifth-generation fighters are the most advanced fighter jets currently in operation, and include using major technologies that were developed during the 21st century, such as stealth, supercruise performance, and low-probability-of-intercept radars.', 'These features made it hard for enemy radars to detect these jets.', 'Examples of fifth-generation fighter jets include Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)s

military technologies that countries across the world are deploying to strengthen their defense.', 'Considering how much each aircraft costs, it is very likely that a big chunk of all defense expenditure of $2.24 trillion in 2022 was incurred on procurement of fighter jets.', 'For instance, Finlands military spending rose 36% between 2021 and 2022, and the increase was mainly attributed to the arms procurement, especially Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)s F-35 fighter jets, which made up nearly one-thirds of its defense expenditure that year according to the Stockholm

western fifth-generation fighter jets, and can be used for various missions like ground attack, reconnaissance, and air security.', 'According to defense experts, Shenyang FC-31 is likely to be used as an aircraft carrier based naval fighter jet.', 'Its price is estimated to be $70 million, as per AeroTime.', 'The JAS 39 Gripen was known to be among the cheapest 4 or 4.5 generation fighter jets with its C and D variants.', 'That has now changed with the launch of its E and F versions.', 'These upgraded single-engine, supersonic fighter jets manufactured by Swedish defense company Saab AB are

Col. Becky Heyse said.', 'It was not immediately clear how the other services will adapt their missions.', 'QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CLUTCH The first Ospreys only became operational in 2007 after decades of testing.', 'But more than 50 troops have died either flight testing the Osprey or conducting training flights over the programs lifespan, including 20 deaths in four crashes over the past 20 months.', 'In July, the Marine Corps for the first time blamed one of the fatal Osprey crashes on a fleet-wide problem that has been known for years but for which theres still not a good fix.', 'Its known as hard clutch engagement, or HCE.', 'The Ospreys two engines are linked by an interconnected drive shaft that runs inside the length of the wings.', 'On each tip, by the engines, a component called a sprag clutch transfers torque, or power, from one proprotor to the other to make sure both rotors are spinning at the same speed.', 'That keeps the Ospreys flight in balance.', 'If one of the two engines fails, the sprag clutch is also a safety feature: It will transfer power from the working side to the failing engines side to keep both rotors going.', 'But sprag clutches have also become a worrying element.', 'As the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps began looking at HCE events following incidents in 2022, they determined that the clutches may be wearing out faster than anticipated.', 'Since 2010, Osprey clutches have slipped at least 15 times.', 'As the system re-engages, hard clutch engagement occurs.', 'In just fractions of a second, an HCE event creates a power spike that surges power to the other engine, which can throw the Osprey into an uncontrolled roll or slide.', 'A power spike can also destroy a sprag clutch, essentially severing the interconnected drive shaft.', 'That could result in the complete loss of aircraft control with little or no time for the pilots to react and save their Osprey or crew, Rivolo said.', 'In the 2022 crash of a Marine Corps MV-22 in California that killed five Marines, hard clutch engagement created an unrecoverable, catastrophic mechanical failure, the investigation found.', 'The fire was so intense it destroyed the Ospreys flight data recorder — another issue the Marines have pushed to fix, by requiring new flight data recorders to be better able to survive a crash.', 'OSPREYS HAVE BEEN GROUNDED BEFORE After Air Force Special Operations Command experienced two hard clutch engagement incidents within six weeks in 2022, the commander, Lt. Gen. James Slife, grounded all of its Ospreys for two weeks.', 'An undisclosed number of Ospreys across the military were grounded again in February 2023 as work began on clutch replacements.', 'But getting replacements to all the aircraft at the time depended on their availability, Slife said in 2022.', 'And even that replacement may not be the fix.', 'Neither the services nor defense contractors Bell Textron or Boeing, which jointly produce the Osprey, have found a root cause.', 'The clutch may be the manifestation of the problem, but not the root cause, Slife said.', 'In last weeks crash, Japanese media outlet NHK reported that an eyewitness saw the Osprey inverted with an engine on fire before it went down in the sea.', 'If eyewitness accounts are correct, Rivolo said, clutch failure and a catastrophic failure of the interconnected drive shaft should be investigated as a potential cause.', 'After its investigation of the 2022 crash, the Marine Corps made several recommendations, including designing a new quill assembly, which is a component that mitigates clutch slippage and hard clutch engagement, and requiring that all drivetrain component materiel be strengthened.', 'That work is ongoing, according to the V-22 Joint Program Office, which is responsible for the development and production of the aircraft.', 'A new quill assembly design is being finalized and testing of a prototype should begin early next year, it said.', 'WHISTLEBLOWER QUESTIONS Materiel strength was the subject of a whistleblower lawsuit that Boeing settled with the Justice Department in September for $8.1 million.', 'Two former Boeing V-22 composites fabricators had come forward with allegations that Boeing was falsifying records certifying that it had performed the testing necessary to ensure it maintained uniform temperatures required to ensure the Ospreys composite parts were strengthened according to DOD specifications.', 'A certain temperature was needed for uniform molecular bonding of the composite surface.', 'Without that bond, the components will contain resin voids, linear porosity, and other defects that are not visible to the eye which compromise the strength and other characteristics of the material, and which can cause catastrophic structural failures, the lawsuit alleged.', 'In its settlement, the Justice Department contended Boeing did not meet the Pentagons manufacturing standards from 2007 to 2018 the whistleblowers contended in their lawsuit that this affected more than 80 Ospreys that were delivered in that time frame.', 'In a statement to The Associated Press, Boeing said it entered into the settlement agreement with the Justice Department and Navy to resolve certain False Claims Act allegations, without admission of liability.', 'Boeing said while composites are used throughout the V-22, the parts that were questioned in the lawsuit were all non-critical parts that do not implicate flight safety.', 'Boeing is in compliance with its curing processes for composite parts, the company said.', 'Additionally, we would stress that the cause of the accident in Japan is currently unknown.', 'We are standing by to provide any requested support.', 'The V-22 Joint Program Office said that since the 2022 incidents, significant progress has been made toward identifying the cause of the hard clutch engagement.', 'While the definitive root cause has not yet been determined, the joint government and industry team has narrowed down the scope of the investigation to a leading theory, it said in a statement to the AP.', 'The leading theory involves a partial engagement of some clutches which have been installed for a lengthy period of time.', 'This has not yet been definitively proven, but the data acquired thus far support this theory.', 'Bell assembles the Osprey in a partnership with Boeing in its facilities in Amarillo, Texas.', 'Bell would not comment on last weeks crash, but said it works with the services when an accident occurs.', 'The level of support is determined by the service branch safety center in charge of the investigation, Bell spokesman Jay Hernandez said.', 'In its report on the fatal 2022 crash, the Marine Corps forewarned that more accidents were possible because neither the military nor manufacturers have been able to isolate a root cause.', 'It said future incidents were impossible to prevent without improvements to flight control system software, drivetrain component material strength, and robust inspection requirements.']","['Ospreys safety issue long grounded .',

the challenges of putting out fires involving the material.', 'The fire is shaping up as a key test of the safety of composite materials compared with conventional airplane fuselages made of aluminum.', 'Investigators appear to be focusing immediately on communication between the pilots of both planes and air traffic controllers at Haneda Airport.', 'A transcript released Wednesday indicated that the landing Japan Airlines A350 had permission to use the runway but the Japanese coast guard plane did not.', 'Safety experts are praising the airlines crew after everybody was able to escape the burning jetliner.', 'Five people on the coast guard plane were killed.', 'Composites have been used for many years inside commercial planes, such as the floorboards and other structures.', 'Boeing built the first commercial plane with a fuselage and wings made from composites reinforced with carbon fibers, the 787.', 'The plane went into airline service in 2011, and about 1,100 have been produced.', 'Airbus followed in 2018 with the A350 — like the two-year-old plane involved in Tuesdays collision — and has sold about 570 of them.', 'WHAT IS THE MATERIAL?', 'In airplanes, composite materials contain carbon fiber to give more strength to plastic and other materials.', 'According to Boeing, they produce weight savings of about 20% compared with aluminum — a significant amount, considering how much less fuel a lighter plane will burn.', 'The strength of composites was tested during certification by regulators including the Federal Aviation Administration, and Boeing said it made changes in the 787 as a result, but experts say there are limits to our understanding of the materials performance.', 'There has always been a concern about composites if they catch fire because the fumes are toxic, said John Goglia, a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates accidents in the United States.', 'That threat continues as long as the airplane burns — actually after, because those little fibers might be floating around in the smoke.', 'DID IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE?', 'While the Japan Airlines plane caught fire, filling the cabin with smoke, all 379 passengers and crew members were able to escape.', 'That fuselage protected them from a really horrific fire — it did not burn through for some period of time and let everybody get out, said safety consultant John Cox.', 'That is a positive sign.', 'Goglia said there is no real-world evidence on whether composite skins are any better or worse than aluminum at resisting fire and heat long enough to give passengers a chance to escape.', 'Aircraft manufacturers are supposed to show that their planes can be evacuated in 90 seconds with half the exits blocked, although skeptics question the accuracy of U.S. government-run tests.', 'On Tuesday night, video captured a fireball on the JAL plane as it continued down the runway after the crash.', 'The flammability issue is something they have to look at, but obviously nobody (on the jetliner) burned to death, said aviation attorney Justin Green.', 'It seems the fuselage and the seats (made of fire-retardant material) and everything else protected the flight crew and the passengers.', 'IS THE SMOKE ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS?', 'Passengers on the Japan Airlines plane said the cabin filled with thick smoke within minutes.', 'Videos posted by passengers showed people using handkerchiefs to cover their mouths and ducking low as they moved toward the exits.', 'There has long been concern about toxic smoke released when carbon-reinforced composites burn.', 'As far back as the 1990s, the Federal Aviation Administration said the main health hazards from composites present in plane crashes and fires were sharp splinters from exposed material, fibrous dust, and toxic gases generated from burning resins.', 'From early reports, it appears that there was a significant amount of smoke in the cabin, and it is not yet clear if any of the smoke was from burning composites, said Todd Curtis, a former Boeing engineer who is now a safety consultant.', 'Curtis said a key follow-up for investigators and regulators will be monitoring whether passengers or firefighters were injured by exposure to toxic smoke from the burning composite.', 'Those injuries could take a long time to show up, said Steven Marks, an aviation attorney.', 'He said passengers involved in accidents are usually in shock and often dont immediately recognize the severity of their injuries.', 'WAS THE FIRE HARDER TO PUT OUT?', 'Another concern, experts said, was the amount of time it took firefighters at Haneda to extinguish the blaze, and the risk to the first responders.', 'Curtis, the former Boeing engineer, said both in the Haneda crash and a 2013 fire on an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 787 that was parked at Londons Heathrow Airport, putting out the fire took much more effort than with a typical airliner fire.', 'The official report said the fire at Heathrow started with crossed wires in the planes emergency locator transmitter, but added, The resin in the composite material provided fuel for the fire, allowing a slow-burning fire to become established in the fuselage crown.', 'Curtis said that incident made him worry about fuselage fires on the ground and in the air back in 2013, and these concerns have not gone away.']","['jet carbon-composite fiber fuselage burned Tokyo runway .', 'material safe ?']","['fuselage jetliner involved collision Tokyo runway made carbon-composite fiber , incident renewing

bolstering its revenue generation prospects.', 'The turbulence between Russia and Ukraine in the recent past, along with the ongoing hostility prevalent in the Middle East, has led nations to strengthen their warfare capabilities to deter any warfare-like situation or sudden assault.', 'In this context, the demand for missiles may increase manifold as these have immense destructive power to support military operations efficiently.', 'Looking ahead, per a report from the Morder Intelligence firm, the missiles and missile defense market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 4.8% during the 2024-2029 period.', 'This should benefit RTX, which enjoys an extensive missile portfolio containing AIM-9X Sidewinder, SM-6, SM-3 interceptor, TOW missiles along with a few more, thereby boasting strong demand in the missile market.', 'Considering the solid growth opportunities offered by the global missile and missile defense market, other major defense primes like Northrop Grumman NOC,

regulator said the companys production practices must meet demanding safety standards for which its accountable.', 'The investigation stems from a midair blowout of a so-called door plug on a 737 Max 9 jet operated by Alaska Airlines on Jan. 5.', 'This incident should have never happened and it cannot happen again, the agency said in a statement.', 'The probe compounds troubles unfolding at Boeing after the fuselage panel blew off Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 shortly after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, with 177 aboard.', 'The agency said it aims to determine whether Boeing failed to ensure completed products conformed to its approved design and were in a condition for safe operation in compliance with FAA regulations.', 'The FAAs announcement and letter indicate the agency is poised for a broad examination of Boeings aircraft production operations that could expose the company to severe civil penalties, said Jeff Guzzetti, the former accident investigation chief at FAA.', 'Such a probe could go beyond Boeings 737 Max factory near Seattle to include its plant in Charleston, South Carolina, where it assembles the 787 widebody, as well as key suppliers such as Spirit Aerosystems Holdings Inc., which makes most of the 737 fuselage, Guzzetti said.', 'Its a sweeping investigation, Guzzetti said in an interview.', 'It gives the agency carte blanche to come in and investigate anything they want related to aircraft production processes.', 'In a letter to Boeing laying out its decision, the FAA said it was notified of additional discrepancies on other 737 Max 9 aircraft after the accident, though it didnt provide details.', 'Boeing said it will cooperate fully and transparently with the investigations.', 'The FAAs move heightens the stakes for Boeing, which already is facing heavy scrutiny over a series of quality issues across its aircraft programs.', 'Regulators grounded 171 of the 737 Max 9 jets in operation after the Alaska accident to allow for inspections, prompting Max 9 operators to cancel hundreds of flights.', 'United Airlines Holdings Inc., the largest operators of the model, found loose bolts on several jets during preliminary inspections.', 'Alaska Air Group Inc. has said loose hardware was visible on some of its other Max 9 planes during examinations that followed the accident.', 'United Airlines didnt immediately comment on the FAAs latest action.', 'Alaska Airlines didnt respond to a request seeking comment.', 'Boeing closed down 2.3% to $222.66 in New York trading on Thursday, extending its decline this year to 15% amid the near-disaster and Max 9 grounding.', 'The FAAs decision comes after US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Wednesday hinted that the Max 9 wouldnt be rushed back into service.', 'At a transportation conference in Washington, he said the aircraft would remain grounded until regulators deem them safe to fly, which he called the only consideration.', 'The FAA is showing that they are being very aware and executing their oversight in a transparent way, but are also putting Boeing on notice that they want some answers, said John Cox, chief executive of Safety Operating Systems, an aviation consulting firm.', 'They want to be sure all the manufacturing processes and procedures are followed to the letter.', 'Federal regulators have stepped up oversight of Boeing since a pair of 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019 killed 346 passengers and crew.', 'Agency inspectors are required to sign off on every 737 and 787 prior to delivery, work it had previously delegated to employees of the planemaker.', 'Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, home to Boeings 737 operations, said the latest accident warrants additional scrutiny of both Boeings operations and its watchdog.', 'In a letter to FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker on Thursday, Cantwell requested documents from agency safety audits of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems over the last two years.', 'In short, it appears that FAAs oversight processes have not been effective in light of the Alaska Airlines accident and other recent incidents, wrote Cantwell, who chairs the Senate panel with jurisdiction over aviation safety.', 'The midair blowout followed a series of embarrassing quality lapses that have weighed on the companys push to boost production and deliveries of the 737 Max.', 'Boeing in December asked operators of newer Max jets to inspect the rudder area for loose hardware.', 'Those checks came after a separate problem in which Boeing determined that supplier Spirit had improperly drilled holes in a section of the Maxs fuselage that helps maintain cabin pressure.', 'In the accident last week, an almost-new 737 Max 9 saw a large panel of the left-side fuselage eject during flight, leaving passengers exposed to a gaping hole.', 'Nobody was seriously injured and the plane returned safely, but pressure is building on Boeing and its senior management to explain the defect.', 'In a companywide address on Wednesday, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dave Calhoun said the company acknowledged its mistake and stressed that workers must elevate safety as their top priority.', 'The FAA

Seattle fliers are switching their trips to Delta Air Lines as hometown carrier Alaska Airlines schedule takes a hit from the latest Boeing 737 Max grounding.', 'Delta President Glen Hauenstein said Friday that the carrier has seen a small uptick in bookings in Seattle since the Federal Aviation Administration grounded all 737 Max 9 planes with door plugs last Saturday.', 'Alaska operates 65 737-9s with door plugs and the grounding is forcing it to cancel between 110-150 flights per day.', 'United operates 79 of the 737-9s with door plugs.', 'However, Uniteds cancellations are a smaller percentage of its schedule – it has a 945 plane-strong mainline fleet compared to 230 for Alaska.', 'Its kind of minimal in the grander scheme of things, but its relevant in Seattle, Hauenstein told analysts on Deltas fourth-quarter earnings call.', 'Both Alaska and Delta have hubs in Seattle.', 'Delta reported an adjusted operating profit of $6.3 billion for 2023.', 'That translates to an operating margin of 11.6%.', 'Its adjusted net profit was $4 billion.', 'The boost Delta sees in Seattle comes amid still strong overall travel demand in the U.S. Executives described the market as exciting, and said they expect unit revenues — how much an airline earns per seat mile flown — to turn positive by the end of the first quarter.', 'The domestic U.S. has faced too much airline capacity since last summer, which has pushed airfares — and unit revenues — down in many markets.', 'Some airlines, including discounters Frontier and Spirit, as well as JetBlue even forecast 2023 losses.', 'Thats why Delta, and others, are focused on slowing growth to boost revenues in the market.', 'And the fact that Delta executives made no mention of weak or slowing travel demand indicates that the number of travelers is at least holding steady.', 'One very positive development: Travel volumes from large corporate customers, think Fortune 500 companies, has recovered to roughly 90% of pre-pandemic levels, Hauenstein said.', 'That gives Delta hope that it could see a full recovery in corporate travel volumes this year.', 'Delta unveiled a long-anticipated order for up to 40 Airbus A350-1000s on Friday.', 'The deal includes 20 firm aircraft with deliveries from 2026, plus 20 options it could exercise later.', 'More A350s for Delta was not a surprise.', 'The airline made the decision in 2020 to streamline its widebody fleet around Airbus planes — the A330neo and A350 — when it retired its Boeing 777 fleet.', 'And Boeings decision to kill its new mid-market airplane program in early 2022 meant the Virginia-based airframer was almost certainly out of the running to provide a Boeing 767 replacement to Delta.', 'Now we have clarity on Deltas widebody fleet plan.', 'A350-1000s will sit at the top with seating for nearly 400 passengers, followed by A350-900s, and A330-900s, -300s, and -200s.', 'We will see a cascade of new A350-1000s replacing smaller -900s on certain routes, which in turn will replace A330s that will eventually allow the retirement of its aging 767s.', 'Delta plans to pull 767-300ERs from long-haul routes by 2028, and retire the planes by 2030, Hauenstein said.', 'The larger — and newer — 767-400ERs will continue to fly into the 2030s.', 'One big question is whether the supply chain issues that continue to dog the industry will force adjustments in Deltas fleet plan.', 'Asked Friday whether he expected the situation to improve this year, CEO Ed Bastian said: I hope theres no more surprises, but Id be lying to you if I thought thats the case.', 'We had a fantastic year in the transatlantic, Hauenstein said of 2023.', 'Were hoping to beat that, but theres a really high bar as we move through the year.', 'Bookings to Europe through April are pretty exciting with unit revenues up high single digits, he said.', 'That is particularly encouraging given the first few months of the year is the slowest period for U.S.-Europe travel.', 'But, as Hauenstein noted, Delta faces a high bar to beat last years transatlantic performance this summer.', 'Airlines, after seeing the record numbers last year, have piled on with new flights this summer.', 'The additions come from major carriers like American Airlines and the Lufthansa Group, as well as discounters Norse Atlantic Airways and Play Airlines.', 'Airline capacity between the Europe and U.S. is scheduled to increase nearly 9% in for the three months beginning in June, according to Cirium Diio schedules.', 'Delta is less bullish on its Latin America and Pacific franchises this year.', 'While Hauenstein expects revenue growth in both regions, the airlines own expansion — and recovery — mean unit revenues are forecast to stay depressed well into 2024.', 'Delta posted a $1.3 billion adjusted operating profit and a 9.7% operating margin in the fourth quarter.', 'Revenues increased 12% to $12.2 billion compared to a year earlier.', 'Total unit revenues decreased 3% while unit costs excluding fuel increased 1%.', 'For the full year, revenues at Delta increased 15% to $58 billion.', 'Total unit revenues decreased 2% on a 2% increase in unit costs excluding fuel.', 'Delta forecasts 3-6% more revenue on roughly 6% more capacity in the first quarter.', 'It expects a roughly 5% operating margin in the period.', 'And, for the full year, it plans to

reaffirming his overweight ratings for three semiconductors and also raising his price targets.', 'Lets go through some of those here.', '195 from 170 for AMD, 740 from 650, for NVIDIA and 115 from 100.', 'And this is a big deal, particularly because it moved the markets.', 'We saw AMD stock up a little over 6%, nearing 7% throughout the day.', 'NVIDIA up 2.3%, and Micron up 2.6% into Tuesdays trade.', 'We also saw some positive feedback for AMDs AI products and their server processors, with increased demand for their MI300X, gaining a little bit of market share there.', 'And NVIDIAs next-gen AI chip expected to come in Q3 with 50% better performance and 40% higher pricing, also giving their stock a little bit of a bump when that was announced at CES earlier on.', 'So seeing a lot of that continued demand for chips moving these stocks higher and making the analyst ratings a little bit more positive, Josh.', 'JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, so I thought the money line in the note is when he just kind of went through his checks, right?', 'And they actually indicate kind of a-- whats interesting is kind of a mixed backdrop because he says broad-based end-demand trends actually remain weak.', 'Thats what he told his clients.', 'So auto industrial, dealing with inventory destocking, says PCs bouncing along the bottom, traditional server, weak, right?', 'But AI, that was kind of the

inspections on undelivered MAX Jets.', 'So this ones-- a few different headlines here.', 'First of all, Boeing, it has been a rough start to 2024 for a lot of reasons.', 'One of which, just check out the stock, its now down about 20%, Madison, so far this year.', 'Of course, that follows this incident on the Alaska Airlines flight and all the kind of ripple effects weve seen from that.', 'For investors, one key question there has clearly been how this impacts deliveries going forward?', 'And now, you do see these analysts kind of weighing in.', 'Team at Wells Fargo cut their rating to equal weight, so a hold now, talking about the risk here on deliveries.', 'MADISON MILLS: Yeah, its interesting because it begs the question, is it time to buy the Boeing stock?', 'And if you listen to the analyst ratings, thats a hard no, when you look at this name, right?', 'But its-- I mean, if you look at the stock, its obviously on sale if you look at it from one perspective.', 'If you look at it from another, the stock is tanking on some negative headlines.', 'The question is whether or not its a good investment.', 'The Zacks consensus estimate for the current year has increased 5.7%

today after beating fourth-quarter earnings results while simultaneously posting the banks lowest annual profit since 2019.', 'Shares of Morgan Stanley in the red after the companys reported fixed-income and equities trading revenue fell short of Wall Street expectations, overall beating top-line forecasts.', 'Its so funny because it felt like I was going into this week big bank earnings were going to be the news following that big beat from JP Morgan on Friday.', 'And then we had those Waller comments really pouring cold water on my coverage plans here when it comes to the big banks.', 'I thought it was really interesting, though, hearing from Morgan Stanleys CEO warning of the geopolitical risks ahead, specifically citing the amount of downside risks to come that could weigh on the bank in 2024.', 'Again, intensifying geopolitical risks and the state of the US economy, but reiterating, though, the base case of a soft landing as well.', 'JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, Morgan Stanley.', 'So a new man in charge over there, Ted Pick, has taken over.', 'Tough welcome for Mr.', 'Pick in todays trade.', 'A key metric here it sounds like really net revenue from the wealth unit 6.65 billion.', 'That was higher than what the Street expected, but then it sounds like that focus on wealth management margins reported a pre-tax margin 24.9% for the full year, and then exec saying on the call that margins could consolidate in kind of the mid 20s range over the near-term, and perhaps that was kind of a drag on the stock.', 'MADISON MILLS: Yeah, and finding ways to gain revenue

Max 9 blew open mid-flight earlier this month have not yet determined if bolts were installed on that piece of the aircraft.'],"['Investigators probing why part of a Boeing 737 Max 9 blew open mid-flight earlier this month have not yet determined if bolts were installed on that piece of the aircraft.', 'National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy told reporters after a closed-door briefing for lawmakers Wednesday that the investigation into is ongoing.', 'Investigators are determining why a door plug, which is supposed to cover up a space left by a removed emergency exit door in the side of the plane, blew off Alaska Airlines flight 1282 on January 5 and left a gaping hole in the side of the plane.', 'She said the investigation is not solely focused on the bolts, and her teams are currently collecting extensive records on the assembly of the door plug and its journey from Malaysia, where it was first built, to factories in Wichita, Kansas and Renton, Washington.', 'It was unclear, she said, whether Boeing employees removed the plug from the airplane fuselage when it arrived in Renton from its subcontractor, Spirit Areosystems.', 'Scientists in the NTSBs lab are currently scrutinizing the plug but have not yet started disassembling it, she said.', 'They have very bright lighting.', 'Theyre doing targeted photography, Homendy said.', 'They might take some metal shavings and put them under the electron microscope.', 'Then next week, NTSB officials will begin pulling the door plug apart to further examine its construction.', 'Homendy said she and the head of the Federal Aviation Administration, who participated in the Senate Commerce Committee briefing virtually, have been talking once or twice most days.', 'The FAA announced Wednesday that it is expanding its probe into Boeing 737 Max 9 quality control following this months in-flight blowout.', 'In a new statement, the FAA says it is now investigating contractor Spirit AeroSystems, which builds the fuselage of the Boeing 737 Max 9.', 'The FAA last week\xa0opened an investigation\xa0into Boeings quality control after the Alaska Airlines incident.', 'The FAA says the investigation will focus on whether Boeing failed to ensure completed products conformed to its approved design and were in a condition for safe operation in compliance with FAA regulations.', 'Boeing said it will cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA and the NTSB on their investigations in a statement last Thursday.', 'Spirit Aerosystems did not immediately respond to a request for comment.', 'The FAA says all 171 Boeing 737 Max 9s in the United States remain grounded, the agency has received new data from preliminary inspections of 40 of those airplanes.', 'The first 40 inspections that are part of that process are now complete, and the FAA will thoroughly review the data from them, the FAA said in a statement.', 'Once the FAA approves an inspection and maintenance process, it will be required on every grounded 737-9 Max prior to future operation.', 'To help restore confidence in its manufacturing, Boeing said Monday it will allow airlines into Boeing factories and those of Spirit AeroSystems.', 'Shareholders of Spirit AeroSystems last year filed a federal lawsuit against the company, accusing it of widespread and sustained quality failures in its products.', 'The suit states that quality failures, which have allegedly ranged from debris in products to missing fasteners and peeling paint, led Boeing to place Spirit on probation from around 2018 to at least 2021.', 'The suit, which was previously reported by the publication The Lever, does not specifically mention door plugs.', 'The suit claims that constant quality failures resulted in part from Spirits culture which prioritized production numbers and short-term financial outcomes over product quality, and Spirits related failure to hire sufficient personnel to deliver quality products at the rates demanded by Spirit and its customers including Boeing.', 'The suit further states that a former Spirit AeroSystems employee who worked as a quality manager and inspector\xa0and who was not named in the suit wrote an ethics complaint to the company in 2022 that described an excessive amount of defects in products.', 'The former employee believes Spirit treats moving products down the line as more important than quality, according to the suit.', 'A spokesperson for Spirit AeroSystems,\xa0Joe Buccino,\xa0said in a statement last week that\xa0Spirit strongly disagrees with the assertions made by plaintiffs in the amended complaint and intends to vigorously defend against the claims.', 'Spirit will not comment further as to the pending litigation.', 'In April, Spirit AeroSystems\xa0identified\xa0a production issue on the aft fuselage section of certain\xa0737\xa0models.', 'This is not an immediate safety of flight issue.', 'We have processes in place to address these of types of production issues upon identification, which we are following, the company then said in a statement.', 'In August, the company\xa0disclosed\xa0improper holes drilled on the aft pressure bulkhead on some models of the\xa0737\xa0fuselage.', 'Both Spirit and Boeing said in\xa0statements\xa0that the issue was determined not to be an immediate flight-safety concern.', 'This story

to aircraft trader Jetran, which is bullish on the aircrafts prospects.', 'The post Jetran buys Cargojet rights for 777 freighter conversions appeared first on FreightWaves.']","['Aircraft dealer Jetran LLC has acquired the rights to four Boeing 777-200 converted freighters from Cargojet, which this week dropped plans to buy the long-haul aircraft along with a modification package for main-deck cargo transport, FreightWaves has learned.', 'Cargojet on Monday said it was backing out of commitments with Mammoth Freighters, a startup aerospace firm backed by Fortress Investment Group that has designed an airframe conversion kit for 777 passenger aircraft, because of soft international demand for airfreight.', 'Instead, it will focus on maximizing utilization of existing Boeing 757 narrowbody and 767 medium freighters in its Canada overnight express network and on international charter routes.', 'The airline had previously telegraphed that two of the large freighters would be operated for DHL Express, but co-CEO James Porteous on Thursday said Cargojet changed its mind when it couldnt get firm commitments for the other two units and realized economies of scale werent possible with such a small fleet.', 'Cargojet originally envisioned having eight 777s, but last year it decided not to move forward with an investment in four 777-300s — eventually selling them and canceling production slots at an Israeli retrofit company.', 'Porteous said the -300s were speculative investments that didnt pan out with express operators or other cargo airlines once demand began contracting in 2022 from record highs fueled by the pandemics disruption of supply chains.', 'Spreading the fixed cost of hiring crews, pilot training, flight simulator time, spare parts and maintenance infrastructure across several revenue aircraft is much more efficient with a larger fleet, according to aviation experts, and Cargojet realized that even four aircraft were too few to justify the upfront expenditures.', 'It had budgeted $1.2 billion to launch the 777 program.', 'When we looked at the cost of capital as a public company — everything from ramping up the number of pilots [and maintenance staff] we would need to hire to cover the first two aircraft and routes for DHL, plus all the spare parts and tooling, and wed have to buy or build a hangar at our hub in Hamilton [Ontario] because the aircraft doesnt fit in our existing hangars — we just finally came to the conclusion this doesnt make economic sense.', 'Its not a great use of capital, Porteous said in a phone interview from an investor conference in Whistler, British Columbia.', 'Cargojet netted $75 million to $82 million from buying and selling the 777-200s, according to Mondays announcement.', 'Porteous declined to identify who bought the 777-200s and a flight simulator, but Jetran confirmed it is the buyer.', 'Jetran basically decided to step into Cargojets commitments to take those four airplanes because we see tremendous value in the [777 passenger-to-freighter] program and that asset class, CEO Jordan Jaffe said in an interview.', 'He declined to say how much Jetran paid for the aircraft or who the end user will be.', 'Mammoth Freighters, which is working to validate its design and get it certified by the Federal Aviation Administration for use in commercial aircraft, has 35 confirmed orders.', 'Jetran has more than 20 of them, including nine 777-200s that will be resold to DHL Express.', 'Mammoth has a large maintenance hangar in Fort Worth, Texas, where conversion kits are being installed using Mammoths design, as well as a licensed contractor in the United Kingdom.', 'It will also offer conversions for the 777-300.', 'Assembly work involves gutting the planes interior, adding a rigid barrier to protect the cockpit, installing a large door for pallets and reinforcing the floor to support heavy loads.', 'The process typically takes four to five months for a large airliner, but prototype aircraft used for validation flights and certification take longer to complete.', 'The downturn in the air cargo market since the spring of 2022 has chilled orders for factory-built and converted freighters, raising concerns of a potential glut in narrowbody freighters as prior orders continue to be fulfilled.', 'Analysts say there still is a need for more widebody capacity with Boeing last year ending production of the 747 jumbo jet, Western sanctions against Russia for invading Ukraine effectively removing many extra-large freighters from the market, airlines retiring MD-10 and MD-11 freighters, and other aircraft starting to reach the end of their useful life.', 'Jaffe said Cargojets decision doesnt reflect on its sales forecast or confidence in Mammoth Freighters.', 'Theyre extremely well capitalized.', 'They have an A-team of industry experts and some of the best facilities weve ever seen, he said.', 'Jetran, based in Horseshoe Bay, Texas, last year acquired five 747-400 freighters, which are more than 20 years old, from Taiwan-based China Airlines in a sale-leaseback as a gateway platform for new 777 converted freighters or next-generation 777s to be built by Boeing, said Jaffe.', 'The jumbo freighters, he explained, allow Jetran to pursue new customers that can eventually move into the 777 and provide a bridge for existing customers that need aircraft until the Mammoth conversions are available.', 'Airlines can take a short-term lease of three or four years and then transition to the 777 converted freighters.', 'I dont mind using the 747 as essentially a stopgap airplane, Jaffe said.', 'The 777s are heavy-lift aircraft that can carry more than 100 tons.', 'The wide fuselage makes them well suited for dense freight and light e-commerce shipments.', 'Mammoths 777-300 converted freighter is designed with 14% more volume than a 747-400 and is ideal for lightweight freight that takes up space because it has more interior volume but a similar weight payload to the 777-200.', 'That translates into 10 more main-deck pallet positions than the -200LR.', 'The 777-300 is ideal for medium-length routes of about eight hours.', 'The 777-200 is aimed more at long, intracontinental routes.', 'Both variants are twin-engine aircraft and much cheaper to operate than four-engine 747s.', 'Cargojet is focusing on its existing fleet of 41 freighters — 17 Boeing 757 narrowbody aircraft and 24 Boeing 767 medium widebodies.', 'The commonality of the flight deck with one pilot for both aircraft types, commonality of parts, makes a lot more sense for us to continue, especially in the domestic Canada market, Porteus told FreightWaves.', 'We feel we can continue to grow the ACMI [dedicated contract transport] business with DHL with the 17 or 18 aircraft that we have operating with them today.', 'Porteus acknowledged that Cargojet likely wont be able to sell four Boeing 757s recently identified as surplus because the industry has an oversupply of standard-size cargo jets.', 'He said Cargojet may be able to lease two aircraft and will return the others to service when parcel and freight demand pick up again.',

Defense ETF (NYSEARCA:XAR), and the Invesco Aerospace  Defense ETF (NYSEARCA:PPA).', 'Im bullish on the defense sector as a whole for several reasons.', 'Unfortunately, geopolitical tensions are escalating in several hotspots worldwide, as illustrated by the ongoing clashes in the Red Sea.', 'Furthermore, the aerospace and defense sector is attractive because these are excellent businesses that enjoy significant strategic moats.', 'They have longstanding relationships with their customers (governments), and this industry features significant regulatory barriers to entry.', 'Furthermore, building these types of products requires substantial technological expertise and investment in RD.', 'Because of these factors, it is difficult for newcomers to disrupt these companies.', 'With this in mind, which is the best defense ETF?', 'According to BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the iShares U.S. Aerospace  Defense ETF seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of U.S. equities in the aerospace and defense sector.', 'The fund invests in U.S. companies that manufacture commercial and military aircraft and other defense equipment.', 'ITA has been around since 2006, and it is the largest aerospace and defense ETF with $5.9 billion in assets under management.', 'ITA has provided investors with solid returns over the years.', 'As of December 31, 2023, the fund has generated an annualized three-year return of 11.2%, an annualized five-year return of 9.2%, and an annualized 10-year return of 10.3%.', 'The fund owns 36 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 76.15% of assets.', 'Below is an overview of ITAs top 10 holdings using TipRanks holdings tool.', 'As you can see, its very concentrated in its top holdings, like Raytheon (NYSE:RTX) and Boeing (NYSE:BA), which have massive weightings of 17.6% and 16.6%, respectively.', 'Overall, this has been a good ETF over the years, but this outsized position in Boeing may be cause for concern at this point, as the aircraft manufacturer has become embroiled in a number of mishaps early in 2024.', 'These include the highly-publicized incident in which the door plug came off of a Boeing 737 midflight, causing an emergency landing, and a collision involving two Boeing airplanes at Chicagos OHare airport.', 'Boeing clearly faces significant questions going forward, and the issues led several sell-side analysts to downgrade the stock.', 'ITA gives investors a lot of exposure to the troubled stock, which is cause for concern.', 'Turning to Wall Street, ITA earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 27 Buys, nine Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months.', 'The average ITA stock price target of $134.24 implies 10.75% upside potential.', 'Lastly, ITA features an expense ratio of 0.40%, meaning that an investor in the fund will pay $40 on a $10,000 investment annually.', 'ITA has been a strong performer over the years, but its large position in Boeing could be a headwind in the short-to-intermediate term.', 'This brings us to the SPDR SP Aerospace  Defense ETF.', 'State Streets XAR launched in 2011 and has $1.9 billion in assets under management.', 'According to fund sponsor State Street, XAR seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, generally correspond to the total return performance of the SP Aerospace  Defense Select Industry Index.', 'This is a modified equal-weighted index which provides the potential for unconcentrated industry exposure across large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks.', 'This modified equal-weighted approach is appealing because it means that, unlike ITA, XAR doesnt have massive exposure to Boeing.', 'While Boeing makes up 16.6% of ITA, XAR has a more manageable 3.5% weighting towards Boeing.', 'In fact, it isnt even one of XARs top 10 positions.', 'In total, XAR owns 35 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 41.6% of the fund, so it is far less concentrated than ITA.', 'Below is an overview of XARs top 10 holdings using TipRanks holdings tool.', 'As you can see, XAR is more diversified than ITA, as its top holdings like Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON), L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX), and Raytheon (NYSE:RTX) each have weightings of just 4.2%.', 'As of December 31, 2023, XAR generated a fairly underwhelming three-year annualized return of 6.3% but much more impressive five- and 10-year annualized returns of 12.2% and 11.7%, respectively.', 'This three-year return was worse than ITAs, but its five- and 10-year returns were slightly better.', 'Like ITA, XAR earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buys, 10 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months.', 'The average XAR stock price target of $148.13 implies 14.75% upside potential.', 'Finally, XARs expense ratio of 0.35% is the cheapest of the group.', 'Im constructive on XAR, given its strong long-term five- and 10-year performance, its lower exposure to Boeing, and the fact that it has the most cost-effective expense ratio of these three major defense ETFs.', 'Invescos PPA launched in 2005 and has $2.6 billion in AUM.', 'According to Invesco (NYSE:IVZ), PPA invests at least 90% of its assets in the SPADE Defense Index, an index that is comprised of the stocks of companies that are involved in the development, manufacturing, operations and support of US defense, homeland security and aerospace operations.', 'PPA has outperformed both ITA and XAR in recent years.', 'As of December 31, the fund has an annualized three-year return of 12.1%, an annualized five-year return of 14.8%, and an annualized 10-year return of 13.3%.', 'PPA holds 52 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 52.2% of assets.', 'Below is an overview of PPAs top 10 holdings using TipRanks holdings tool.', 'As you can see, like XAR, PPA has a more manageable position in Boeing (accounting for 5.05% of the fund).', 'On the downside, PPA is the most expensive of these three funds, with an expense ratio of 0.58%.', 'PPA earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 40 Buys, 12 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months.', 'The average PPA stock price target of $99.14 implies 9.7% upside potential.', 'In conclusion, Im optimistic about all three of these ETFs as the aerospace and defense sector looks well-positioned for the short term based on escalating tensions worldwide and for the long term based on the strong moats these businesses enjoy.', 'All three are good ETFs, and they all invest in similar businesses.', 'One key difference is that ITA is much more exposed to Boeing than the other two ETFs discussed here.', 'Given the considerable issues that Boeing is dealing with right now, this could be a detriment to ITA, going forward.', 'Based on that, I am ranking XAR and PPA ahead of ITA at this point in time.', 'PPA and XAR have a lot in common, and both feature lower exposure to Boeing.', 'PPA has generated slightly better returns, but I view XAR as the best choice at the moment because its expense ratio is significantly lower than PPAs, making it the winner here.']","['ITA , XAR , PPA : Defense ETF Better Buy ?']","['geopolitical tension heat around

John Richardson, former CEO of Continental Airlines Lawrence Kellner, former Inspector General of the Air Force Gen. Stayce Harris, and Carrier Global CEO David Gitlin.', 'Yet the continued flare-up of safety issues means that something is evidently getting lost in translation between the board and the manufacturing and assembly lines–and the challenge runs much deeper than any single incident.', 'How deeply the new quality control processes have permeated into Boeings production plants is an open question.', 'One wonders whether safety-focused voices are sufficiently empowered internally, as one whistleblower report claimed that Boeings own quality control systems were routinely ignored with under-pressure line inspectors sometimes providing false or erroneous information, which would be consistent with long-running complaints of underinvestment and inadequate self-policing.', 'Calhouns appointment of an external safety expert to review Boeings safety processes is a step in the right direction–but the FAA appears to be pushing for more wholesale and permanent changes, including embedding FAA or third-party monitors directly across Boeings supply chain, unsatisfied with mere auditing.', 'By all appearances, Boeing has lost functional oversight and control over its suppliers, an issue that has been exacerbated by a lack of supply chain diversification and accountability.', 'This is embodied by Boeings dysfunctional relationship with Spirit AeroSystems, which manufactures virtually all of Boeings fuselages.', 'For years, we have presciently and repeatedly warned about the latent risk posed by Spirit to Boeings operations, as the soft underbelly in the supply chain, and how former CEO Harry Stonecipher made a mistake by selling Spirit in 2005–but new whistleblower reports suggest that this dysfunctional marriage may be even worse than we appreciated.', 'According to a fresh report in the Seattle Times this week, citing an anonymous but credible whistleblower, Boeing engineers found no less than 392 instances of Spirit quality control failures over the last year.', 'In one instance, Spirits engineers supposedly repaired the issues, only for the Boeing inspector to discover that Spirit merely painted over the problematic parts, forcing Boeing to do any further repairs in-house.', 'Additional reports document how Spirit employees were encouraged not to report problems amidst a culture of fear, intimidation, and cost-cutting, with expert veteran engineers replaced by legions of cheaper and undertrained replacements.', 'Boeing has refused to respond to media requests for comment, citing ongoing investigations.', 'Meanwhile, Spirit has issued a statement saying that their primary focus is the quality and product integrity of the aircraft structures they deliver, adding that the company was working with Boeing on the matter and following regulators protocols.', 'Although the Spirit leadership ranks have almost completely turned over in the last four months amidst apparent pressure, and even if accomplished new CEO Pat Shanahan is committed to fixing Spirits process challenges, the last 20 years have shown that Spirit should not be a standalone company, period.', 'No matter how much Boeings financial whiz kids resist the prospect of diluting Boeings prized free cash flow with Spirits low-margin, capital-intensive business, and wobbly balance sheet, one has to wonder whether a sum equivalent to 3% of Boeings market capitalization is worth all the operational headaches, especially as Boeing continues to inject hundreds of millions into Spirit to keep it afloat.', 'The silver lining here for Boeing is that almost all of its suppliers are heavily dependent on Boeing and thus, all are aligned and motivated to urgently fix these underlying, long-deferred structural challenges together.', 'As the old Churchill saying goes, Never let a good crisis go to waste.', 'So far, Calhoun has won plaudits for his reassuring media interviews, all-staff meetings where he spoke about safety in personal terms as a father and grandfather, and desperately needed meetings with Congress in the days after the Alaska Air incident.', 'Similarly, Calhoun was praised for letting his airline customers send inspectors to any Boeing or Spirit manufacturing plant in response to the public condemnations of major customers such as the CEOs of Hawaiian, United, and Ryanair.', 'But getting the MAX 9s back into the sky may have been the easy part.', 'As the FAA digs in for protracted, intrusive oversight into Boeings internal process challenges in the months ahead, it will become progressively harder for Calhoun to control the narrative and continue fortifying public trust.', 'When Boeing faced similarly protracted regulatory reviews before, some of Calhouns predecessors of were ill-advised to hide behind exceedingly vague, impersonal legalese in deference to regulators and investigators–which did not end well.', 'This time around, Boeings challenge is even more acute since there will almost certainly need to be difficult but necessary tradeoffs in the months ahead.', 'For example, even though Boeing has said repeatedly that building and delivering more MAXs is their top priority this year, many analysts consider it likely that Boeing will need to lower the lofty production and financial targets laid out merely months ago, and will likely need to withhold guidance during its highly anticipated earnings call on Wednesday.', 'Some have also floated the prospect of internal reorganizations as accountability beckons.', 'Now more than ever, Justice Louis Brandeis quip that sunlight is the best disinfectant rings true.', 'Public safety and fortifying public trust must outweigh all short-term commercial impacts, no matter what investors or lawyers say.', 'Needless market panic, employee confusion, and sensationalized speculation can be avoided if tough but necessary moves are packaged and perceived as a part of a broader strategic plan to restore Boeings credibility, rather than being seen as reactionary impulsiveness or palace intrigue.', 'Furthermore, showing an accountable human face of leadership–rather than hiding behind bureaucratic processes or delegating bad news to subordinates–can go a long way in making bad news more palatable.', 'Many airline executives are now joking that the old mantra, if its not Boeing, Im not going will be at risk of turning into if its Boeing, its not going unless Boeing can revive its safety culture soon.', 'Where Boeing goes from here will largely depend on whether they are seen as having safe planes in the clouds–or whether they are seen as having their own heads in the clouds.', 'Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is the Lester Crown Professor in Management Practice and Senior Associate Dean at Yale School of Management.', 'He was named

National Safety Transportation Board, which is investigating, is expected to release its preliminary findings soon.', 'Thats the Boeing of today and the last five years.', 'But it wasnt always that way.', 'It wasnt that long ago that Boeings reputation was that of a staid industrial giant, known for building the safest, most advanced planes in the sky.', 'It helped introduce the world to commercial jet travel.', 'Pilots and others in the industry, as well as members of the flying public, summed up their confidence in the company with the expression, If its not Boeing, Im not going.', 'The company still sells\xa0coffee cups\xa0and\xa0t-shirts\xa0with that slogan.', 'So how in the world did the company whose brand was once synonymous with safety become mired in reputational disaster – to the point where at least one travel site has a feature that allows passengers to avoid Boeing 737 Max planes altogether.', 'Experts and critics say that Boeings woes have been years in the making, some pointing to the result of a shift in corporate culture that started at the top and put profits ahead of the safety and engineering prowess for which it was once praised, placing not only its future, but the passengers on its planes, at grave risk.', 'While Boeing denies there has been such a shift away from safety and excellence, what is indisputable is that its engineering and manufacturing problems have contributed to a series of shocking incidents, two of which resulted in the deaths more than 300 people combined.', 'Boeing simultaneously became a financial basket case, reporting cumulative net losses of more than $26 billion, and counting, over the last five years, with no end to the red ink in sight.', 'Boeing executives insist that quality and safety are still a top priority for the company, and the problems of recent years have only increased its focus on quality and safety.', 'Asked for comment on the claim that it now puts profits ahead of quality and safety, the company pointed to a recent statement by CEO Dave Calhoun.', 'Over the last several years, weve added rigor around our quality processes, hired tens of thousands of engineers and mechanics, advanced key investments in our future, transformed our functions and gradually increased our production rates, he told investors in October.', 'Most importantly, weve worked hard to instill a culture of speaking up and transparently bringing forward any issue, no matter the size, so we can get things right for the future.', 'A week after Calhoun made the remark, the company delivered a 737 Max 9 to Alaska Air, the fourth it had built for the carrier that month.', 'Code letters N704AL, the jets door plug blew out while the plane was mid-air, less than 10 weeks after it was delivered, just minutes into the January 5 flight.', 'The company also pointed to what it called a quality stand down, on Thursday for its 737 factory teams in Renton, Washington in which it halted production to focus on quality issues.', 'Boeing announced the move in the wake of a recently expanded federal probe into the companys manufacturing practices following the Alaska Air incident and plans for Congressional hearings into its practices.', 'The first 737 Max 9 planes that were grounded after that incident returned to service on Friday, and most are expected to be back in the air by the end of this week.', 'Our long-term focus is on improving our quality so that we can regain the confidence of our customers, our regulator and the flying public.', 'Frankly, we have disappointed and let them down, said a statement by Stan Deal, the head of Boeings commercial airplane unit, in a statement to employees following that return to service.', 'Over the last century, the people of Boeing have faced and overcome significant challenges.', 'This is one of those times.', 'We have to be better.', 'We have to deliver perfect airplanes each and every time.', 'But critics say this crisis is unlike any earlier problems at the company, arguing that despite Boeings assurances, they believe there has been a cultural change within the company in the last 25 years that has put profits over safety and quality.', 'Leadership is more concerned with\xa0getting the planes out the door than quality, Ed Pierson, a former Boeing executive who is now the executive director of the Foundation for Aviation Safety, a public interest group, told CNN last week.', 'He said planes are still being produced today with flaws not being caught.', 'The spark for the conflagration that has recently consumed Boeing might date back decades.', 'After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the huge American defense contractors began to consolidate.', 'Fearful of their own survival without a communist enemy stalking NATOs borders\xa0they\xa0began to merge with one another.', 'In the decade after the end of the Cold War, 51 major American defense and aerospace contractors\xa0became just five huge companies.', 'And one of the five left standing was Boeing, newly merged in 1997 with competitor McDonell Douglas.', 'Critics said that before the merger, Boeing had a reputation as a company run by people with engineering backgrounds who cared about quality and safety first.', 'But those critics say the merger put the company in the hands of executives with a finance background, who put profits as their top goal.', 'Boeing had a reputation before the merger of a company where engineers were high church, Ron Epstein, an\xa0aerospace analyst at Bank of America, told CNN.', 'It resulted in Boeing not being as profitable as some comparable manufacturers, he said.', 'But after the merger he said, everything had to be cost-justified.', 'On paper, Boeing was the company that bought McDonnell Douglas.', 'But many of the leadership ranks became filled with McDonnell Douglas veterans, not Boeing executives.', 'Many of them had financial backgrounds, not the engineering backgrounds of those who had run Boeing in the past.', 'Or they came from outside of the company, such as from General Electric, where cost-cutting and improved efficiency was a near religion.', 'One of those was Jim McNerney, who became Boeing CEO in 2005, after a career that started at consumer products maker Procter  Gamble, included time at management consultant McKinsey  Co., and was followed by years at GE.', 'He was CEO of 3M before being tapped to run Boeing, without any engineering and limited aerospace experience.', 'Under this leadership the company moved away, figuratively and literally, from its Pacific Northwest roots, where top executives had been intimately familiar with the massive assembly lines there where commercial jets were built, and any problems that might be developing there.', 'In 2001 it moved its headquarters to Chicago.', 'And in the midst of various crises in recent years, it moved its headquarters again in 2022,\xa0not back to Seattle, but to a\xa0suburb of Washington, DC,\xa0near the Pentagon, Capitol Hill, and its various regulators, like the FAA.', 'Ironically the move to Washington came the same week Airbus\xa0revealed that it was increasing production of commercial jets at its factory in\xa0Mobile, Alabama, only seeming to drive home the point to critics that Boeing was moving in the wrong direction.', 'One company is saying Were going to build lots of jets.', 'The other is saying Were going to lobby the Pentagon and Congress for defense dollars.', 'Its a big contrast, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory and a leading aerospace analyst.', 'Boeing became more dependent on suppliers to build more and more of its planes, seeking to limit its role to joining together the parts.', 'And it spun-off some of the operations it had depended upon previously.', 'Supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which builds the fuselages for Boeings planes, including the 737 Max, was created in 2005 after Boeing sold its Wichita division and Oklahoma operations raising $900 million in cash by doing so.', 'And in 2009, about a year after weathering a 58-day strike at its unionized plants in Washington state, the company announced plans for a non-union plant in right-to-work South Carolina to assemble its new, most advanced jet, the 787 Dreamliner, giving it a factory with lower pay that wasnt at risk of going on strike in the future.', 'Calhoun, Boeings current CEO, took over in January 2020, nine months into the grounding of the 737 Max following two fatal crashes.', 'He also has no engineering background, having served as senior managing director and head of portfolio operations at investing firm The Blackstone Group, CEO of Nielsen and spending 26 years at GE.', 'Just over a year and a half later, after the pandemic reduced demand for the long-range Dreamliner due to the drop in international travel, Calhoun and Boeing decided it needed to\xa0preserve cash\xa0and could no longer justify two 787 plants.', 'It had a choice between consolidating production to a veteran plant in Washington state staffed by unionized employees and a non-union South Carolina plant.', 'It decided to close the unionized line in Washington and keep the South Carolina plant.', 'But it soon had quality problems with the 787 Dreamliners being produced there, leading to two costly halts in deliveries, one lasting over a year.', 'Although Boeing says it values its worldwide staff, it made deep staff cuts during the economic downturn caused by the pandemic, offering buyouts to more senior workers.', 'The loss of expertise has proven devastating, Bank of Americas Epstein said.', 'A key variable is your workforce, he said.', 'You want it to be as experienced as possible.', 'When its all said and done, how much do you really save closing the unionized plant?', 'Aviation safety advocate Pierson served as a senior manager at Boeings 737 factory after a career in the military.', 'He left the company in 2018, just months before the first fatal crash.', 'He told CNN his frustration with top management attitudes on quality led him to quit.', 'In 2019 he testified to Congress that there was evidence that the 737 Max was having production quality issues, including planes being delivered to airlines that had faulty hardware or other system malfunctions, problems that involved more than a dozen safety issues, some of which he described as serious.', 'He recounted that he had recommended a halt in production of the 737 Max to deal with quality issues in the months ahead of the first crash.', 'He said the boss to whom he had made the recommendation told him, We cant do that, I cant do that.', 'A terrifying 10 minute flight adds to years of Boeings quality control problems I pushed back, explaining that I had seen operations in the military shut down over less substantial safety issues, and those organizations had national security responsibilities, he testified.', 'He said his supervisor responded tersely, The military isnt a profit-making organization.', 'Other experts agree with Pierson that despite its claims of being concerned with safety and quality, Boeings actions suggest otherwise.', 'Youre looking at a management team whose idea of acknowledging the problem is to readjust the cash flow numbers for next year, said Aboulafia in an interview with CNN.', 'And then disaster struck.', 'The first fatal\xa0crash of a 737 Max\xa0occurred\xa0in Indonesia in October 2018, the\xa0second in Ethiopia in March 2019, killing a total of 346 people.', 'It led to a 20-month grounding of all 737 Max jets.', 'In addition to the horrifying loss of life, it cost the company more than $21 billion, making it one of the costliest corporate disasters on record, as well as one of the most deadly.', 'After the first crash, Boeing successfully pushed to keep the planes in the air.', 'Even after the second crash, as airline regulators around the world\xa0grounded the jet, Boeing pushed the FAA to hold off on its own grounding order, saying that it had full confidence in the safety\xa0of the 737 Max and that based on the information currently available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance to airlines.', 'When the FAA gave in to\xa0global and public pressure to announce its\xa0own grounding, Boeing said it accepted the move out of an abundance of caution.', 'Eventually it was a design flaw in the Max that was blamed for the two fatal crashes, as a feature meant to stop the planes from climbing too fast and stalling instead forced the nose of the planes downward.', 'But critics of Boeing say the problem wasnt just the flawed design of the jet that led to the deaths, it was the decisions that Boeing made to not quickly acknowledge the problem with design after the first crash, and have a grounding take place at that time, which could have prevented the second crash.', 'In the light most favorable to Boeing, the first crash was an accident, the second crash is a crime, said Robert Clifford, the attorney suing Boeing on behalf of families of the victims of the second crash, the one in Ethiopia, in an interview with CNN.', 'He said if the plane had been grounded immediately, Boeing might have ended up fixing the problem much faster, and with less expense, as well as preventing the second crash.', 'They gambled with peoples lives and the people lost, he said.', 'In 2021 Boeing admitted to liability in the two crashes, agreeing to pay compensatory damages, which allowed the company to avoid the possibility of having to pay far more in punitive damages.', 'Boeing is committed to ensuring that all families who lost loved ones in the accidents are fully and fairly compensated for their loss, the company said in a statement at that time.', 'By accepting responsibility, Boeings agreement with the families allows the parties to focus their efforts on determining the appropriate compensation for each family.', 'It has also agreed to pay a $2.5 billion fine to settle charges it defrauded\xa0the FAA when it first won approval of the flawed 737 Max.', 'I firmly believe that entering into this resolution is the right thing for us to do — a step that appropriately acknowledges how we fell short of our values and expectations, Calhoun said at that time.', 'But that agreement was criticized by the families of victims of the Ethiopian air crash as well as members of Congress as being far too lenient.', 'About 70% of the $2.5 billion fine it agreed to pay was money it had already agreed to pay as compensation to its airline customers.', 'Pierson said the probe that followed the second crash revealed\xa0Boeing executives\xa0were more concerned with continued production than finding the cause of the crash and fixing it.', 'They absolutely prioritized the delivery of planes over the investigation, he said.', 'Pierson said the design flaw, as problematic as it was, was not the total problem that led to the crash.', 'He said the quality of the work that would produce various malfunctions while the planes were in flight was just as significant as the design flaw.', 'He points to a report from the Ethiopian Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau that looked at both fatal crashes and found that These accidents were triggered by production quality defects that… presented as intermittent system malfunctions.', 'Without the build quality issues causing malfunctions, the design flaw feature of the plane that forced the nose of the plane down would not have turned on, and the flights would not have crashed, according to the Ethiopian report.', 'But that finding got little attention as the US National Transportation Safety Board and the FAA focused on design flaws rather than the build\xa0quality issues, Pierson said.', 'Eventually the probe provided an ugly look at the\xa0decision-making process\xa0at Boeing.', 'Internal communications released during the 737 Max grounding showed one employee describing the jet as designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.', 'Boeings release of the documents included an apology to the FAA, Congress, airlines, and the public.', 'An ironic part of Boeings focus on profits is that it has resulted in a company that is\xa0in the worst financial shape in its more than 100-year history, with five years of deep losses already,\xa0and more expected losses ahead.', 'As recently as 2018 Boeing was riding high, reporting revenue of more than $100 billion for the first time in its history and projecting more growth to come.', 'It had just started deliveries of the 737 Max the year before.', 'The short-term focus on profits was, indeed, producing profits.', 'At least for a little while.', 'Its rival Airbus was the one struggling, on the verge of abandoning its $25 billion mistake, the A380 superjumbo jet that had turned out to be a white elephant with little demand from airlines or passengers.', 'Despite that, the two companies were neck-and-neck in orders and deliveries.', 'But in less than a decade, all that has changed.', 'Airbus delivered 735 commercial jets last year.', 'Net orders and the backlog of jets each is waiting to build show a larger imbalance.', 'And while Airbus is forecast to report adjusted net income of 4.3 billion euros, or $4.7 billion profit, for 2023 when it reports results, Boeing just reported an operating loss of $3.2 billion for the year.', 'Aboulafia said the short-sighted push for profits has put the company at\xa0a severe competitive disadvantage to Airbus, and that Calhoun and other top managers at Boeing, as well as its board, need to go if the company is to have a chance to turn things around.', 'Despite the losses and severely weakened market position of Boeing, there is little chance it could go out of business.', 'The airlines around the world that have already bought Boeing planes basically need to keep using those models, whatever the problems.', 'Commercial pilots are certified on specific models\xa0and are not able to easily move\xa0from single-aisle to widebody versions of Boeing jets, let alone between a Boeing and an Airbus jet.', 'And having different models means the airlines need to have a large, expensive supply of spare parts on hand to keep their planes in the air.', 'And any Boeing customer who canceled their orders today would have to get in line behind a backlog of more than 8,600 jets that Airbus has already agreed to build for its existing customers.', 'Its a very weird industry.', 'It has high barriers to entry and only two players.', 'You can get away with nonsense like this, said Aboulafia.', 'Pierson said incident reports on planes that Boeing continues to build, while not nearly as dramatic as the Alaska Air incident, suggest the\xa0pressure to put profits over quality remains, despite Boeings claims.', 'The company has gutted quality control so they can produce more airplanes, he said.', 'The employees are completely overwhelmed.', 'Everybody is focused on the Max 9, and rightfully so.', 'That incident should never have happened.', 'But there are issues on other planes.', 'It has become a recipe for disaster.']","['Boeing known safety engineering .', 'critic say emphasis profit changed']","['Part fuselage blowing shortly takeoff , leaving gaping hole plane , phone clothing ripped away
