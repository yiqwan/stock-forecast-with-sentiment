George cites five ways Boeing could get back on track—including: enhanced focus on quality, closer examination of the supply chain, and relocate its headquarters to Seattle. George does not appear hopeful about speedy adoption of improvement strategies, noting “they’re fixing a piece at a time.” Referring to CEO Dave Calhoun’s competency George states plainly “he’s [Calhoun] acting like a short-term CEO.” George believes that the culture of the company has shifted from “a quality, aviation design culture” to “a short-term, finance-based culture,” and believes the suitable person for the CEO role should be an expert in aviation.  For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

When you look at the Spirit and JetBlue transaction, very similar in the sense where JetBlue wanted additional lift and if you had to go to an OEM [Original Equipment Manufacturer] and order new planes, it's going to take a long period of time.
