Bank of America Senior Aerospace & Defense Analyst Ronald Epstein joins Yahoo Finance Live to explain his call and to break down why Boeing’s woes might not be as severe as some may think. Epstein believes that the cause for the recent Alaska Airlines incident, is unclear, ""it's not clear who did what in this,"" suggesting that there is not yet enough information to draw a conclusion on the actual cause of the incident and who may be to blame, whether it was Boeing, Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), or another company involved in the production. Epstein sees the incident as ""a bump in the road,"" and does not expect there to be a huge impact on the company. Considering the ""huge aerospace ramp up"" post-COVID and the fact that the 737 Max model in question is not the manufacturer's only model, Epstein insists that Boeing will still fare well. While acknowledging the dip in the stock in response to the news, Epstein does not believe this will negatively impact demand, stating “demand for aircraft is outstripping the ability for the industry to supply them.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

George cites five ways Boeing could get back on track—including: enhanced focus on quality, closer examination of the supply chain, and relocate its headquarters to Seattle. George does not appear hopeful about speedy adoption of improvement strategies, noting “they’re fixing a piece at a time.” Referring to CEO Dave Calhoun’s competency George states plainly “he’s [Calhoun] acting like a short-term CEO.” George believes that the culture of the company has shifted from “a quality, aviation design culture” to “a short-term, finance-based culture,” and believes the suitable person for the CEO role should be an expert in aviation.  For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.
